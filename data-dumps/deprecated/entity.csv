3;3;2;;DIPimage;DIPimage is a MATLAB toolbox for scientific image processing and analysis build on the DIPlib image library. It is a tool for teaching and research in image processing. Most operations are independent of dimensionality, and are defined for any data type that MATLAB can store. Many functions are available through a GUI, which makes them more accessible to novices. The interactive image display windows, to which images can be automatically displayed after each operation, provide great insight into the image data.<br />DIPlib is a platform independent scientific image processing library written in C. It consists of a large number of functions for processing and analysing multi-dimensional image data. The library provides functions for performing transforms, filter operations, object generation, local structure analysis, object measurements and statistical analysis of images. Key design features include ample support for different data types (binary, integer, floating point, complex) and dimensionalities.;;;;

2110;;4;;Introduction to DIPimage;The goal of this laboratory work is to get hands-on experience with image processing. To do so, you will have to learn the image-processing environment: MATLAB and the DIPimage toolbox for multi-dimensional image processing. To facilitate a quick start, there will not be an in-depth explanation of all the features in the software. We will briefly present the things you need at this moment. We have marked the sections that explain something about the environment with the?symbol, so that they stand out. Let us start with a short introduction to the MATLAB environment.;;;ftp://qiftp.tudelft.nl/DIPimage/docs/Introduction_to_DIPimage.pdf;
2112;;4;;Image Analysis;The goal of this laboratory course is to get hands-on experience with image processing.

First we want to stress one point: Try to understand what is happening, and do not be satisfied with just any answer you obtain! It is by far better that you seriously wor on half of the exercises and learn some image processing, than that you go through all of them, but understand nothing. This is a waste of your time.;;;http://www.cb.uu.se/%7Ecris/Documents/ipcourse.pdf;

2116;2116;79;;WIS-PhagoTracker;WIS-PhagoTracker is a software application for quantitative analysis of high throughput cell migration assay. The cell migration assay is based on a modified Phagokinetic tracks procedure, in which motile cells "leave their tracks" on a specialized surface. These tracks are visualized using a screening microscope.

WIS-PhagoTracker enables morphometric analysis of such tracks. It uses multiscale segmentation algorithm for fine detection of tracks and cells boundaries. Following the segmentation step, it quantifies various morphometric parameters for each track, such as track area, perimeter, major and minor axis and solidity. All these measures are calculated for each track in each well of a well plate and saved for further statistical analysis

WIS-PhagoTracker supports all the analysis phases starting from preprocessing, finding tracks of selected wells or a whole plate, through viewing the results and manually rejecting tracks to statistical analysis of the results. It also supports batch processing of several plates, and analysis of single image files. A user interface enables the user to modify the relevant parameters of the process, according to specific image's requirements. Results are exported into Excel readable files.

2267;2267;2;;ImgLib2;ImgLib2 is a generic, multi-dimensional data processing library allowing for processing algorithms to be defined in a data-type, dimension, and container independent manner. Due to its interface-based design, it is easy to write adapters to virtually all existing data containers. It is the basis of KNIME, ImageJ2 and a couple of Fiji plugins.

2270;2270;2;;Definiens Developer;Definiens is a commercial  image segmentation and classification tool. The user designs a signal processing workflow by combining built-in filtering, thresholding and object classification modules. Object detection is typically done on hierarchical object levels, e.g cell level for  cell objects and organelle level Nucleus and ER obejcts inside a cell object.
For each object, a huge set of features (shape-based, intensity based, relations to neighbor objects...) is available and can be used for object classification or merging with neighboring objects. 
The classical definiens workflow is the so called bottom-up approach: In a first step, the image is segmented in numerous small objects, resulting in a heavy oversegmentation of of the target objects. Objects are then fused step by step on basis of features like “relative border to neighbor object” or “elliptic fit of resulting (fused) object”. Objects can assigned to different classes (like “nucleus” or “cancer cell”), based on their features. 

Weaknesses:
-complex to use
-closed (no API)
-very expensive
-relatively slow (you have to buy one license for each core)
-bad 3D-visualization
-time lapse analysis is possible but complicated

Strengths:
-powerful method to classify objects based on multiple features
-2D data, especially histological data
-good training material to learn software usage
-detailed documentation

2276;2276;2;;Matlab Image Processing Toolbox;The Matlab image processing toolbox extends the Matlab core functionality with general purpose image processing capabilities. This ranges from image access (read / write), common filters (convolution, morphology, order based, Wiener, feature extraction, image enhancement, ...), image transformation (rotation, affine transformation, ...) to segmentation algorithms (thresholding, watershed, region growing). There is also an extensive list of functions to deal with binary or label mask and perform for instance connected particle analysis or morphological operations.

Strengths:
- Most functions extend to nD
- optimized functions (muti-threaded for some)
- Matlab community (Matlab central)
- relatively low entry-threshold for functionality
- Tutorials & Webinars

Limitations:
- no embedded visualization of nD Microscopy data

The software contains functions that segment cells (based on either fluorescence or phase images),tracks cells in a frame-to-frame manner,build lineage trees and quantitatively extracts fluorescence.
Strength: tools for manually editing segmentation and lineage, well documented, free matlab source code, sample data
Limitations: changes need to be done directly in the matlab code, no support

2283;;137;;Open Image Processing Blog (Matlab) ;This is an open blog, where people from the Image Processing community can present and share parts of their work, expose more people to it, inspire new ideas for projects and make new connections.
The goal is to create a database of useful and unique image processing posts. Most posts should be hands-on, with the MATLAB code of the problem and with clear, easy to follow documentation.

A starting point for beginners and advanced when they encounter a new challenge or as a place to get ideas from.;;;http://www.imageprocessingblog.com;

2284;;93;;Analyzing fluorescence microscopy images with Fiji;(quoted from the book) 
The overall purpose of this book is to provide a path for busy biologists into understanding fluorescence images and how to analyze them, using the free, open-source software Fiji to explore the concepts. No background in image analysis or computer programming is assumed, nor is the maths here very deep. Specifically, if you are at ease with arithmetic, means, medians, standard deviations and the occasional square root, this is enough. There are a large number of questions and practicals strewn throughout the pages. In most cases, my suggested solutions are provided at the end of each chapter. You may well find alternative or better solutions.;;;http://go.qub.ac.uk/imagej-intro;
2286;;92;;The story so far;changes & additions I made:-
* changed the title line of the site from "tag, tag, tag!" to "BioImage Informatics Index"
* requested "context" module, and used it to add a custom front page describing the purpose of the site
* possibly added a picture of some sushi knives (I thought it didn't work, which I was happy with, as I had second thoughts about it - perhaps I forgot to delete it? in my opinion it should be replaced by a nice bioimage analysis graphic)
* added a Forum / Mailing list page that embeds the "bioimage analysis list" google group
* re-arranged the Navigation menu
* re-re-edited the re-edited landing page text to explain why there is a picture of some knives there;;;;

<p>Other changes I did already:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added a module "Active Tag", that allows automatic drop down list of tags.</li>
<li>Added "Road Map", "About" and "Eubias", Basic page.</li>
<li>Added a module "search_log"</li>
<li>Added a module "taxonomy_formatter" for having better tag appearance but not actually working since if term is already added to the Tag field, I cannot change…</li>
<li>Added a new field "self inroduction by users" to the content type peope. I did not know that spaces are allowed, so currently the item title looks ugly with underscores. I'm sorry for this!</li>

</ul>
<p>Kota</p>;;;;
2287;;75;;Languages Landing Page ;changed the Languages page type to "table".
i think this is much nicer than the "unformatted list".
suggest to also consider this for the software packages page (maybe this could resolve the table discussion..).

2264;2264;2;;OMERO;OMERO is a free, open source image management software. It is client-server based system which supports 5D images, including  big images and high-content screening data.  Data are stored on a server using relational database. They are accessed using 3 main clients, a desktop client, a web client and a command line tool. There are bindings from OMERO to other image analysis packages, like FLIMfit, OMERO.searcher.  The data in OMERO are organized in groups. A user can be a member of one or more groups. This groups can be collaborative or private, there are 4 levels of permissions to access/edit/annotate/delete the data of other users.

The package is supported not only by community forums, but also by a dedicated team which helps users to solve their problems and deals with the bugs submitted via error submission system.

**Strengths:** Open source, scalable software, Supports diverse sets of imaging applications and domains (EM,LM, HCS, DigPath)
Cross-platform, Java-based application, API support for Java, Python, C++, Django, On-line Forums, Automatic QA and upload of software errors
Multi-dimensional images, Web access, Free Demo-server accounts

**Limitations:** Enterprise-scale software, so complex install, requires expertise, Actively developing API, Python scripts and functions still developing

<cite>
The application Bio7 is an integrated development environment for ecological modelling and contains powerful tools for model creation, scientific image analysis and statistical analysis. The application itself is based on an RCP-Eclipse-Environment (Rich-Client-Platform) which offers a huge flexibility in configuration and extensibility because of its plug-in structure and the possibility of customization.
</cite>;Dr. Marcel Austenfeld;;http://bio7.org/;
2265;2265;2;;CellProfiler;CellProfiler is designed to enable biologists without training in computer vision or programming to quantitatively measure cell or whole-organism phenotypes from thousands of images automatically. The researcher creates an analysis pipeline from modules that find cells and cell compartments, measure features of those cells to form a rich, quantitative dataset that characterizes the imaged site in all of its heterogeneity.
CellProfiler is structured so that the most general and successful methods and strategies are the ones that are automatically suggested, but the user can override these defaults and pull from many of the basic algorithms and techniques of image analysis to solve harder problems. CellProfiler is extensible through plugins written in Python or for ImageJ.

Strengths: Cells, Neurons, C. Elegans, 2D Fluorescent images, high-throughput screening, phenotype classification, multiple stains/site, interoperability, extensibility, machine learning, segmentation
Limitations: largely limited to 2D, not well suited to manually-guided analysis or content review, image size limitations

Endrov started development in 2007 by Johan Henriksson in the group of Thomas Bürglin group / Karolinska insitutet. At that time it was merely a tool to support the analysis of C. elegans embryogenesis. It was decided to not base it on ImageJ because little of it could be reused, many of the problems came from the core design. Since then the scope of Endrov has expanded to be useful for all image processing and be able to replace ImageJ.

2302;2302;137;;Columbus Image Data Storage and Analysis System;Columbus is a combination of an image database (based on Omero, OME) and an image analysis engine based on Acapella (PerkinElmer). It is dedicated to cell culture based high content screening data and is used via a web interface.
It provides a set importers for automated microscopes such as Yokogawa CellVoyager, PerkinElmer Operetta, PerkinElmer Opera and data in Metamorph format. 

After login, Images can be explored in a standard web browser by clicking on a well plate view. Image analysis workflows can be developed by combining modules like "find nuclei", "find cytoplasm", "find spots" for object detection. Objects can have a hierarchical structure, e.g. spot objects can be part of a cell object. The approach of workflow design  is similar to the freeware cell profiler, but more restricted (less functions and less parameters to tweak) and easier to use. 

Mutliple intensity- and shape based features can be calculated from detected objects (e.g. texture: haralick, Garbor, SER). Objects can be classified by these features by using hard thresholds or by supervised machine learning.


Analysis workflows and results are stored in the database and can be exprted as csv tables for secondary analysis. Simple secondary analysis workflows can be also applied in Columbus directly. Results can be visualized as heatmaps on the plate view. 
The HCS statistics software Genedata Screener Assay Analyzer can be directly connected to the database.

  - I thought this would be a good tool for moving packages in "Function (now called Compnent)" pages to "Software Package" page. 
  - Problem is that since field machine names are different in these content types, importing does not work well. 

- Added [Advanced Form Block](https://drupal.org/project/afb). 
  - This is an attempt to add tag (term) imput field within View page. 
  - test page: <http://biii.info/node/2288>
  - problems
    - page view without login does not allow access to node edit, so there are errors. 
    - This form block can only be specific to a node. Cannot add this as a block to content type. 
 
- The Front page text disappeared after adding Advanced Form Block module. For this reason, I created a new front page.

2309;;11;;Captcha;Added captcha module 

<https://drupal.org/project/captcha>

to avoid spam user registrations (currently 30 or so per day...).

While I was installing this, Biii blanked out (site could not be reloaded, always white.)

Solution: from command line

    drush dis feeds
    drush cc #clears cache
    drush en feeds.

... A bit more detail:

Clearing cache with only feeds_ui being discabled returned error. 

>PHP Fatal error:  Class name must be a valid object or a string in /home/drupal/drupal->7.23/sites/biii.imagej.net/modules/contrib/feeds/includes/FeedsConfigurable.inc on line 59
>Drush command terminated abnormally due to an unrecoverable error.   [error]
>Error: Class name must be a valid object or a string in
>/home/drupal/drupal-7.23/sites/biii.imagej.net/modules/contrib/feeds/includes/FeedsConfigurable.inc,

"feeds" should be disabled, not pnly feeds_ui.

I further added "Recaptcha" module, to have more modern captcha.

Looks even more nice now. 



;;;;
2313;;11;;easy tag cloud, recaptcha, advanced form block;## Tag Clouds

It's been a bit sad having seen no tag cloud so I added an express version of the tag cloud. You probably have already recognized it! This uses a module called "tagadelic". 

<https://drupal.org/project/tagadelic>

It has many modules on top of it such as [cumulus](https://drupal.org/project/cumulus), and I installed it but it did not work... maybe there are too many tags. 

## Patched Advanced Form Block

I already [installed this module](http://biii.info/node/2304) to edit tags in View mode several days ago, but it has a problem that the tag editor can only be added to a specific node, and not possible to do that for a general content type. Today I tried a patch provided by a guy in the Drupal site:

<https://drupal.org/node/2005086>

Applying this patch, it seems to work well now with "Workflow" nodes. We could test this for several days. The tag editor is at the moment placed at the bottom of workflow pages. See for expample:

 [Microtubules Tools (3D)](http://biii.info/node/2312)

## Added a new field to Components.

To actualize the Roadmap figure, I added a "Workflow" link to the content type "Components" (this used to be "functions"). An example case is here:

[AnalyzeSkeleton](http://biii.info/node/1976)

The ImageJ plugin written by Ignacio is used by Volker's "Microtubules Tool (3D)", so this is now linked in the "AnalyzeSkelton" page. Evebtually, this link should be automatically detected by workflow page (or maybe vice versa?) by workflow page and reciprocal links should then be established. 


## Recaptcha

I installed a [module named captcha](https://drupal.org/project/captcha) yesterday but it only blocked 10% or so of spam registrations (about 100 a day and it's increasing). I then upgraded it by adding a module recaptcha:

<https://drupal.org/project/recaptcha> 

Now, after sevral hours, this module already blocked 69 spamming attempts. I show you here the log during last one hour:

2123;2123;16;;CellCognition;## Introduction

CellCognition is a computational framework dedicated to the automatic analysis of live cell imaging data in the context of High-Content Screening (HCS). It contains algorithms for segmentation of cells and cellular compartments based on various fluorescent markers, features to describe cellular morphology by both texture and shape, tools for visualizing and annotating the phenotypes, classification, tracking and error correction. Events such as mitosis can be automatically identified and aligned to study the temporal kinetics of various cellular processes during cell cycle. CellCognition can be used by novices in the field of image analysis and is applicable to hundreds of thousands of images by parallelization on compute clusters with minimal effort. The tool has been successfully applied to quantitative phenotypic profiling of cell division, yet machine learning enables CellCognition to be used for the analysis of other dynamic processes.

2109;2109;103;;VIGRA;VIGRA is a free C++ and Python library that provides fundamental image processing and analysis algorithms. Its generic architecture allows it to be used in many different application contexts and ecosystems. It is designed as an intelligent library (using the C++ template mechanism) which allows users to write code at a fairly high level of abstraction and optimizes away the abstraction overhead upon compilation. It can therefore work efficiently on very large data and forms the basis of ilastik and CellCognition.

CATMAID is a Collaborative Annotation Toolkit for Massive Amounts of Image Data. It is designed to navigate, share and collaboratively annotate massive image data sets of biological specimens. The interface is inspired by GoogleMaps, with which it shares basic navigation concepts, enhanced to allow the exploration of 3D biological image data acquired by optical or physical sectioning microscopy techniques. The interface enables seamless sharing of regions of interest through bookmarks and synchronized navigation through multiple registered data sets.

With massive biological image data sets it is unrealistic to create a sustainable centralized repository. A unique feature of CATMAID is its partially decentralized architecture where the presented image data can reside on any Internet accessible server and yet can be easily cross-referenced in the central database. In this way no image data are duplicated and the data producers retain full control over their images.

CATMAID is intended to serve as data sharing platform for biologists using high-resolution imaging techniques to probe large specimens. Any high-throughput, high-content imaging project such as gene expression pattern screens would benefit from the interface for data sharing and annotation.;Stephan Saalfeld, Albert Cardona, Volker Hartenstein, Pavel Toman?ák;;http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~saalfeld/catmaid/;

Strengths:
- Open-source, free, multi platform, code is highly parallelized, uses git for version control
- Large scale processing, also efficient visualization of such datasets.
- Active learning module for classification
- Most of the algorithms have been extended to handle 16-bit images, and 3D Images.
- Possibility to create complex pipelines thanks to it’s modular architecture
- Editing tools are designed to save the editing operation which can later be used to validate the algorithms performance
- Advance preprocessing algorithms like curvelets, tensor voting, and wrappers around ITK-algorithms
- Multiple viewers included to inspect results such as: Histograms, scatter plots, tables, kymograph, all of them linked together.
- Strong emphasis to work on multichannel images (up to 40 channels)
- Rich number of cell features included 
Weakness:
- GUI is suboptimal compared to commercial packages.
- Tracking module requires an external library CPLEX.
- No support for brightfield images
- No native interoperability with other software packages
- More documentation needed / tutorial needed

Icy was released in April 2011 and is being developed at the Quantitative Image Analysis Unit at the Pasteur Institute in France by Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin and his team.  The goal is to provide standardized software architecture, with a visual programming framework and online repository of plugins and protocols, brought together with sophisticated content-management and communication systems for such extended reproducible research.</p>
<p>Icy provides intuitive user interfaces for graphical protocol development for image acquisition, analysis and storage that are easy to use for biologists and developers alike.  Developers should find that Icy’s ‘EzPlug’ API library, versioning, and auditing tools make creating a custom plugin from most any source easy.  Users will find the automatic error reporting, central repository and on-line community hub great for storing and sharing plugins and protocols.  Icy is even developing a cloud-computing framework to address the scalability issues of high-content screening.</p>

        Vaa3D is a cross-platform (Mac, Linux, and Windows) tool for visualizing large-scale (gigabytes, and 64-bit data) 3D image stacks and various surface data. It is also a container of powerful modules for 3D image analysis (cell segmentation, neuron tracing, brain registration, annotation, quantitative measurement and statistics, etc) and data management. This makes Vaa3D suitable for various bioimage informatics applications, and a nice platform to develop new 3D image analysis algorithms for high-throughput processing. In short, Vaa3D streamlines the workflow of visualization-assisted analysis.

        In our latest development, Vaa3D can render 5D (spatial-temporal) data directly in 3D volume-rendering mode; it supports convenient and interactive local and global 3D views at different scales... it even has a Matlab file IO toolbox.

## ImageJ Macro Usages

[Save orthogonal views | OrthoSaver](http://uic.igc.gulbenkian.pt/macros/OrthoSaver.ijm)

>ImageJ's orthogonal viewer for 3D stacks doesn't let you easily save the current orthogonal view. This macro, once installed, lets users create a montage with the currently open orthogonal views and selection guides. To use it, open an image z-stack and open the orthogonal viewer. With the mouse, choose which are the sections of interest to you and without moving the mouse, press F2. You'll get a montage of the currently selected orthogonal view.

2370;;94;;Protein Micro-array Analysis;;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2375;;94;;Blood vessel segmentation and network analysis;This macro segments blood vessels in a 3D stack. It is suited for well contrasted images (low background) and works better if the width of the vessels of interest is reasonably uniform.;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2377;;94;;Tissue analysis from histological sections;This macro batch processes all the 2D images (tif and jpg files) located in a user defined folder by calling Fiji Weka trainable segmentation to classify each pixel, and reports the areas of each class in a human readable results table. The classifier to be applied to each image should be previously trained on a representative image by an expert and exported to file (Save classifier) into the image folder to be processed.;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2380;;94;;SPIM de-striper;This macro implements a filter that is meant to attenuate close to parallel intensity stripes in an image, such as often happening in light sheet microscopy. The results are usually decent even when the stripes show a large angular spread due to light sheet refraction at the sample surface. The filter can process a 3D stack but the processing is performed slice by slice.;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2381;;94;;Tube un-winder;This macro can be used to un-wide a tubular structure and flatten its surface (like peeling of and flattening the skin of a banana). The macro can only process a single channel 3D stack but it is easy to process multiple channels by exporting and importing ROI manager selections. Technically the macro computes the radial average intensity projection inside a ring centred on the radial symmetry axis of the object. The final image is a radial mapping of the intensity (radial angle along X, axial length along Y).;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2384;;94;;(Z,T) Hyperstack Stitcher;This macro builds a stitched image from a muti-position 3D + time hyperstack. The XY positions of the montage should be coded as channels in the input  hyperstack. Channel ordering can be configured in the dialog box to adapt to Column/Row and Meander/Comb configurations: The images should appear in this order when browsing the hyperstack with the channel slider. Fine stitching is supported (requires sufficient overlap between the views). The XY displacements of each field of view for stitching are computed for a single reference (Z,T) slice (user configurable) and applied to all slices (Z and T).;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2385;;94;;(Z,T,C) Stitcher;This macro can stitch a (Z,T,C) data set with virtually no limit on the number of Z slices and time frames. The input to the macro is a folder with the raw tiff images (one image per file) as typically exported by motorized microscopes. These files must all be stores in the same folder and the file naming should ideally comply to OME-TIFF. The macro is however quite flexible: Only --X, --Y and --Z fields with user defined number of digits are compulsory. --T, --C and --L fields with user defined number of digits are necessary for multiple time frames / channels data sets. A compatible data set is provided as a .zip archive. Before processing it unzip it to a given location.

The stitching is performed in a reference Z slice (and in a specific reference time frame and channel). The same displacements are applied to all the Z slices, time frames and channels. Before starting the batch processing a montage with the original images of the selected Z slice / time frame / channel is displayed together with the stitched image in this stack. If you are not satisfied with the result you can select another reference. The stitching is then performed time frame by time frame and slice by slice and the stitched images are exported to a single user defined output folder.  

The macro can also process a data set with multiple channels, the stitching is then computed once on a reference channel and then applied to the other channels.;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2231;;0;;ilastik - Density Counting;This workflow estimates (densely distributed) object counts by the density of objects in the image without performing segmentation or object detection. Current version only works for 2D images of roundish objects with similar sizes on relatively homogeneous background. Users should provide a few labels of background and objects (especially on clustered objects), and the tool predicts the density of objects on the entire image. Counting is then estimated by integrating the density values on the whole image or specified rectangular regions of interests.

2387;;94;;Interactive Volume of Interest Extractor in Large 3D Stacks;This macro allows to interact with a large, single channel, z-stack (possibly exceeding the main memory of the computer) and to extract a volume of interest by marking several reference points.;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2388;;94;;Image denoising;If your images are corrupted by a strong dominant Gaussian noise you can try this simple filter. It is based on thresholding in the DCT domain and is usually vastly superior to typical Gaussian filtering in term of detail preservation / noise reduction trade-off. The filter unfortunately introduces some block like artifacts that can be mitigated by averaging out overlaping shifted windows (as implemented in the Matlab version) and performing maximum intensity projection after the filtering: As such the filter is way more adapted to process 3D stacks that you plan to maximum intensity project than to process single z slice images.;Sébastien Tosi;;;
2379;;444;;Morphological Segmentation;Morphological Segmentation is an ImageJ/Fiji plugin that combines morphological operations, such as extended minima and morphological gradient, with watershed flooding algorithms to segment grayscale images of any type (8, 16 and 32-bit) in 2D and 3D. 

Morphological Segmentation runs on any open grayscale image, single 2D image or (3D) stack. If no image is open when calling the plugin, an Open dialog will pop up.

The user can pan, zoom in and out, or scroll between slices (if the input image is a stack) in the main canvas as if it were any other ImageJ window. On the left side of the canvas there are three panels of parameters, one for the input image, one with the watershed parameters and one for the output options. All buttons, checkboxes and input panels contain a short explanation of their functionality that is displayed when the cursor lingers over them.

Image pre-processing: some pre-processing is included in the plugin to facilitate the segmentation task. However, other pre-preprocessing may be required depending on the input image. It is up to the user to decide what filtering may be most appropriate upstream. ;Ignacio Arganda-Carreras, David Legland ;;http://fiji.sc/Morphological_Segmentation;
2383;;444;;Marker-controlled Watershed;Marker-controlled Watershed is an ImageJ/Fiji plugin to segment grayscale images of any type (8, 16 and 32-bit) in 2D and 3D based on the marker-controlled watershed algorithm (Meyer and Beucher, 1990). This algorithm considers the input image as a topographic surface (where higher pixel values mean higher altitude) and simulates its flooding from specific seed points or markers. A common choice for the markers are the local minima of the gradient of the image, but the method works on any specific marker, either selected manually by the user or determined automatically by another algorithm. 

Marker-controlled Watershed needs at least two images to run:
    The Input image: a 2D or 3D grayscale image to flood, usually the gradient of an image.
    The Marker image: an image of the same dimensions as the input containing the seed points or markers as connected regions of voxels, each of them with a different label. They correspond usually to the local minima of the input image, but they can be set arbitrarily.
And it can optionally admit a third image:
    The Mask image: a binary image of the same dimensions as input and marker which can be used to restrict the areas of application of the algorithm. Set to "None" to run the method on the whole input image.
Rest of parameters:
    Calculate dams: select to enable the calculation of watershed lines.
    Use diagonal connectivity: select to allow the flooding in diagonal directions.

This pipeline analyzes a time-lapse experiment to identify the cells and track them from frame to frame, which is challenging since the cells are also moving. In addition, this pipeline also extracts metadata from the filename and uses groups the images by metadata in order to independently process several sequences of images and output the measurements of each. ;Cellprofiler team;;;

2404;;92;;Noise Suppression using Simple Spatial Filters;Simple spatial filters can be used to suppress noise in raw image data (i.e. by averaging intensities). The best choice of filter depends on the nature of the noise, but Gaussian filtering works well for Poisson noise (i.e. commonly observed photon-counting shot noise); whereas a median filter is ideal for salt-and-pepper noise. A larger filter radius leads to stronger noise suppression but more blurring. The URL above describes the simple 2D spatial filters available in ImageJ, but similar filters are available in most software. For 3D data, 3D versions of these filters work best (since there are more pixels to average within the same radius).;Graeme Ball;;;

It is best suitable for roundish objects or spots. Tracking is done through segmentation, which can be obtained from ilastik pixel classification, or imported from other tools. Users should provide a few object level labels, and the software predicts results on the rest of the image or new images with similar image characteristics. As a result, all objects get assigned random IDs at the first frame of the image sequence and all descendants in the same track (also children objects such as daughter cells) inherit this ID.;ilastik team;;;
2392;;467;;White Balance ;The Macro processes a composite picture in ImageJ/Fiji.

These values can be changed to make sure that a background region is taken for the calculation in the line: makeRectangle(100,100,100,100). The user could be prompted to draw the region by removing the signs // in the line: // waitForUser("Please draw a region in the background");;Laurent Gelman;;;

2422;;470;;Counting foci;ImageJ's built-in <em>Process -> Find Maxima</em> command can be used for many 2D counting-related tasks.

For counting small, bright foci (dots), set <em>Output type</em> to be <em>Point Selection</em>.  If too many points are detected, the number may be reduced using one or more of the following methods:
<ul>
<li>Apply a filter to reduce noise, e.g. <em>Process -> Filters -> Gaussian Blur...</em> prior to running <em>Find Maxima</em></li>
<li>Set a minimum threshold with <em>Image -> Adjust -> Threshold...</em> prior to running <em>Find Maxima</em>, then use the <em>Above lower threshold</em> option within the dialog box</li>
<li>Increase the <em>Noise tolerance</em> value (which effectively acts as a local threshold)</li>
</ul>

The resulting point selection can be modified (points added/removed) by the <a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#sec:Multi-point-Tool">Multi-Point tool</a>. 

After the points are available, final measurements can be made using <em>Analyze -> Measure</em>.;Michael Schmid, Wayne Rasband;;;
2423;;93;;Pixel Classification using ilastik;This workflow classifies, or segments, the pixels of an image given user annotations. It is especially suited if the objects of interests are visually (brightness, color, texture) distinct from their surrounding. Users can iteratively select pixel features and provide pixel annotations through a live visualization of selected feature values and current prediction responses. Upon users' satisfaction, the workflow then predicts the remaining unprocessed image(s) regions or new images (as batch processing). Users can export (as images of various formats): selected features, annotations, predicted classification probability, simple segmentation, etc.

This workflow is often served as one of the first step options for other workflows offered by ilastik, such as <a href="http://biii.info/?q=node/2410">object classification</a>, <a href="http://biii.info/?q=node/2406">automatic tracking</a>.;ilastik team;;;
2410;;93;;Object Classification using ilastik;This workflow classifies objects based on object-level features (e.g. intensity based, morphology based, etc) and user annotations.

Segmentation images can be obtained from <a href="http://biii.info/?q=node/2423">ilastik pixel classification</a>, or binary segmentation images from other tools. Within the object classification, one can prefilter objects through thresholds (on pixel probability image) or object sizes (on segmentation image). Outputs are predicted classification label images. Selected features can also be exported. Advanced users also have possibilities to add customized (object) features for classification in a simple plugin fashion through python scripts.;ilastik team;;;

2394;;137;;Measure distance of organelles from nucleus in 3D;Below as simple worklow is descibed to measure subcellular localizations relative to the nucleus. 
You may e.g. quantify how far some type of vesicles or protein aggregates are apart from the nucleus border. The forflow describes a solution for 3D data.

Data requirements:

3D data, 2 channels
Channel 1: nucleus stain
Channel 2: stain for marker you want to quantify the distance to nucleus for


Workflow:

1. Nucleus detection
-Add a new SURFACE object, name it "nuclei"
-Follow the object detection wizard to segment nucleus objects

2. Marker object detection
-Add a new SURFACE object
-Follow the object detection wizard to segment nucleus objects

3. Creating of distance map channel
-In the image processing menu, go to SurfacesFunctions>>Distance Transformation
Now Matlab should start
-select nucleus objects and "distance outside objects"
A new image channel should be crated now by the Matlab script

4. Distance measurement
The generated distance map channel represents the distance from the nucleus border in pixel values. Thus, the distance of an organelle from the nucleus is equivalent to its mean gray value of the distcance map channel.  
For distance measurement, just export the mean gray value of the distance channel for each object.

Please note:
In the described workflow, the distance is always calculated to the closest nucleus border. This could be also the nucleus of a neighboring cell, which generates some error. A more complex approach to avoid this error would incorporate a cell segmentation step to assign certain organelle objects to certain cells. Therefore, a cell region marker is needed.

2376;;470;;Quantifying staining in tissue sections;The Color Deconvolution plugin for ImageJ can be used to digitally separate up to three stains from brightfield images, after which standard ImageJ commands can be used.  The algorithm is described in [bib]2451[/bib].

**However**, it is **very** important to take into consideration the caveats on the linked URL.  In particular, note that:

* Stain colors depend on numerous factors, such as the precise stains and scanner; therefore, the 'default' stain vectors (used to define the colors) are unlikely to be optimal and may be very inaccurate.  See the URL instructions for how to create new stain vectors.
* Pixel values should be interpreted with extreme caution; in particular, note the warning regarding 'brown' staining that *attempting to quantify DAB intensity using this plugin is not a good idea*.

Color deconvolution is particularly helpful in separating stains so that stained regions can be detected (e.g. by setting a threshold), and then the number or areas of stained structures may be quantified.  Two potential approaches would be:

1) If one measurement should be made for the entire image:

+ *Image -> Adjust -> Threshold...*
+ *Edit -> Selection -> Create Selection*
+ *Analyze -> Measure*

2) If distinct structures should be measured:

+ *Image -> Adjust -> Threshold...*
+ *Analyze -> Analyze Particles...*;Gabriel Landini;;;

The steps are the following:
1. Makes a 8-bit B&W picture, inverts it (=> borders will look white instead of black), resizes it (optional, this is to speed-up convolution thereafter) and find edges.
2. Convolves the obtained picture with a kernel corresponding to a thick white circle of the size of the wells. The resulting image has big "blobs" or "particles" corresponding roughly to the centers of the well.
3. The image is thresholded to remove particles not corresponding to strong hits and "Analyze particle" is run.
4. The measured parameter is the center of mass of the particles wich gives the center of the well. These are saved in an array.
5. Circles are drawn and added to the ROI manager. The centers of the circles are the identified centers of mass of the particles and their radius is the expected radius of the wells in the original image.;Laurent Gelman;;;
2477;;444;;Analyze Skeleton;This plugin tags all pixel/voxels in a skeleton image and then counts all its junctions, triple and quadruple points and branches, and measures their average and maximum length. The tags are shown in a new window displaying every tag in a different color. You can find it under Plugins>Skeleton>Analyze Skeleton (2D/3D). See Skeletonize3D for an example of how to produce skeleton images.

The voxels are classified into three different categories depending on their 26 neighbors:

    End-point voxels: if they have less than 2 neighbors.
    Junction voxels: if they have more than 2 neighbors.
    Slab voxels: if they have exactly 2 neighbors.

End-point voxels are displayed in blue, slab voxels in orange and junction voxels in purple.

Notice here that, following this notation, the number of junction voxels can be different from the number of actual junctions since some junction voxels can be neighbors of each other. ;Ignacio Arganda-Carreras;;;

This plugin allows to denoise images degraded with stationary noise. Stationary
noise can be seen as a generalization of the standard white noise. Typical
applications of this plugin are:
               - Standard white noise denoising using a total variation and fidelity term
minimization. Figure 1 is an example of this application. Even though
total variation denoising is not the state of the art (regarding SNR im-
provement), it may be very valuable for further tasks such as image seg-
mentation).

Kymoquant analyzes kymograph by treating patterns appearing in kymograph as texture: for a specified area in kymograph, it detects the most likely orientation of streaks and outputs this result as velocity. 

This workflow was created to ease the situation when it is difficult to find major direction of streaks only with eyes.

2274;2274;2;;Imaris;Imaris is a software for data visualization, analysis, segmentation and interpretation of 3D and 4D microscopy images. It performs interactive volume rendering that lets users freely navigate even very large datasets (hundreds of GB). It performs both manual and automated detection and tracking of biological “objects” such as cells, nuclei, vesicles, neurons, and many more. ImarisSpots for example is a tool to detect “spherical objects” and track them in time series. Besides the automated detection it gives the user the ability to manually delete and place new spots in 3D space. ImarisCell is a tool to detect nuclei, cell boundaries and vesicles and track these through time. ImarisFilament is a module that lets users trace neurons and detect spines. For any detected object Imaris computes a large set of statistics values such as volume, surface area, maximum intensity of first channel, number of vesicles per cell etc. These values can be exported to Excel and statistics software packages. The measurements can also be analyzed directly within ImarisVantage which is a statistics tool that provides the link back to the 3D objects and the original image data.

Strengths: 
- good visualization
- user friendly interface
- reads most microscopy file formats
- image analysis workflows are very easy to apply
- interactive editing of objects to correct errors during automatic detection
- large data visualization (hundreds of GB)

2281;;11;;About;Each component and workflow pages are tagged manually with biological and/or image processing term, to develop mutual and organic links between biological and image processing regimes. For more about the aim of this site, please read [About](http://biii.info/node/2281) and [EuBIAS Manifesto](http://biii.info/node/2261).

We started constructing **Biii** on Oct. 11, 2013 during [the first taggathon in Barcelona](http://eubias2013.irbbarcelona.org/taggathon). We made major upgrades and added ca 140 pages of workflows in [the second taggathon in Paris in Dec. 2014](http://eubias.org/eubias2015/?page_id=52). 

#What BIII can do for you, what you can do for BIII

<p>Existing software packages afford a rich range of tools for processing and analysis of microscope images. They are constantly evolving and the number of functions is steadily growing. With so many choices offered to the users, the problem to choose the best tool to answer a specific question is not trivial and is sometimes extremely complex. There is a gap between the rich availability of tools and the users. A simple list of links to software packages does not help much.</p>

<p>We need to have a bridge. Biii (BioImage Information Index) is this bridge, allowing you to search for a tool you need for your bioimage analysis. At the same time you could contribute to this site by adding functions and packages, tagging functions, commenting and evaluating tools.</p>

<p>Biii will continue to evolve, enhancing its usability and its contents.</p>

2360;;85;;spot detection and codistribution analysis;WASH, Exo84, and cortactin spot detection and codistribution analysis To detect endosomes, an automatic Otsu threshold is applied to the Gaussian-filtered MT1-MMP–positive endosome image (= 1.5 pixels for the sample image). Statistics about each endosome are then saved, for example random positioning  of spots can be compared to actual positioning. 

For each endosome, WASH and Exo84 (or WASH and cortactin) spots are searched for in a neighboring of x pixels (manually set by use: XX for sample data) in their respective channel. Their number and position are saved per endosome (**see the macro in Text file S2 downloadable from URL link 1**). 

From the position of WASH and Exo84 (or WASH and cortactin) spots around each endosomes, each WASH spot is paired with its closest Exo84 (or cortactin) spot neighbor, optimized over all spots around this endosome. This allowed measuring of the distribution of distance between WASH-Exo84 (or WASH-cortactin) spots (**for the co-distribution analysis, see matlab scripts in Zip file S3 downloadable from URL link 1**).

2580;;85;;Advances in image correlation spectroscopy: measuring number densities, aggregation states, and dynamics of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in cells.;;;;;
2581;;85;;Microscope Image Correlation Spectroscopy MICS;Fluorescence spectroscopy by image correlation is a technique that allows analysing and characterizing the different molecular dynamics from a sequence of fluorescence images.

Many image correlation techniques have been developed for different applications but in particular to study the mechanisms of cell adhesion during migration. These techniques can be used with most imaging modalities: e.g. fluorescence widefield, confocal microscopy, TIRFM. They allow to obtain information such as the density in molecules, diffusion coefficients, the presence of several populations, or the direction and speed of a movement corresponding to active transport when spatial and temporal correlations are taken into account (STICS: Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy). 
Please see <bib>2580</bib>  for a review and the description of the methods.

This plugin is based on ICS_tools plugin by Fitz Elliott, available [here](http://www.cellmigration.org/resource/imaging/imaging_resources.shtml "cell migration website").

Some bugs have been removed, ROI does not need to be squared, fitting is weighted in order to give more weight to the smaller lags (temporal or spatial)
Exemple of use on sample data [fluorescent beads](http://biii.info/node/2577 "Beads")
- Select an ROI, start by ICS to get the right PSF size
- Then run TICS and select diffusion, or diffusion plus flow model. Remove the first line (autocorrelation) which corresponds to the noise autocorrelation before fitting.

It supports key data formats including: Becker and Hickl .sdt, LaVision BioTech .msr, PicoQuant .bin and OME-TIFF files; as well as several options for curve fitting. Results can be saved back in OMERO, which also facilitates working collaboratively on the data analysis.;FLIMfit developers at Imperial College London;;;
2444;;92;;Manual Tracking with ImageJ;The Fiji ImageJ distribution comes with several manual tracking tools, two of which are particularly useful: 

* _Plugins->Tracking->Manual Tracking_
* _Plugins->Tracking->Manual tracking with TrackMate_ (TrackMate is an advanced automatic tracking tool, with the option for manual editing of tracks)

The _Manual Tracking_ plugin is quick to use, intuitive and produces easy-to-understand output. TrackMate has the advantage that automatic detection and linkage can be combined with manual input.

Pre-processing steps before manual tracking might include:

* denoising and/or deconvolution
* flicker and photobleaching correction, e.g. using Fiji's _Image->Adjust->Bleach Correction_
* flat-field correction, and/or bandpass (ImageJ's _Process->FFT->Bandpass filter_) according to the size of the features of interest;Fabrice Cordelieres; TrackMate developers;;;

Movies interpolate seamlessly between user-defined key frames, and properties such as viewing angle, zoom and visibility of each element can be changed during the animation. These features allow effective communication of results based on image data.;Bitplane;;;
2462;;92;;Organise Image Data using OMERO;OMERO is an image database application consisting of a server and several clients, the most important of which are the web client and _Insight_ java application. Metadata are extracted from images that have been imported (either using the Insight client, or directly from the filesystem), and this is accessible for search. A standardised hierarchy of _Project > Dataset > Image_ in which image thumbnails can be viewed, combined with group membership, tagging, and attachment of results and other files gives a powerful framework for organising scientific image data. Images can also be analysed server-side or client-side within the base OMERO application or one of its many extensions.

2386;;85;;Microtubule Length Analysis;###Task

Quantify the length of microtubules (MT) and the MT average density per cell. 

### Workflow descriptions

Simple two step workflow, allowing visual & manual correction of microtubule between the 2 steps. Batch measurement of microtubule lengths for multiple images is achieved by segmenting the MTs and then their skeletonizations.  The number of pixels in the microtubule is proportional to their length, so the length can be estimated.

### Script

Workflow is written as an ImageJ macro (Fiji) with following steps:

1. The enhancement of tubular structure by computing eigenvalues of the hessian matrix on a Gaussian filtered version of the image ( sigma 1 pixel), as implemented in the tubeness plugin. 
2. The tubules were then thresholded , and structures containing less than 3 pixels were discarded. 
3. If needed, a visual check and correction of segmented microtubule is then performed.  
4. After correction, segmented MTs were then reduced to a 1-pixel thick line using the skeletonize plugin of Fiji.  The length of the skeletonized microtubules was then directly proportional to their length. 
5. Data were grouped by condition and converted back to micrometers units under Matlab for the statistical tests.

2571;;11;;HowTo;## Usage

**biii.info is for searching bioimage analysis tools** (functions, plugins, toolbox, scripts, macros, instructions). Please use the search box in the sidebar. You could narrow your search to components, workflows, sample images, software packages or languages. Your search term could be any keywords that you are interested in. 

At the moment, biological terms might not have many hits, as we still need to tag pages, and your contribution by tagging will be a big help! 

## Terms

We use following terms for categorizing bioimage analysis tools. 
 
- **Components** 
  - Implementation of an image processing / analysis algorithm
  - e.g. A single menu item in image processing software
  - e.g. A plugin / module / add-ons. For plugins that bundles multiple tools, each tool will be the component and the plugin as a whole cannot be a component. Please place the plugin as "Software / Library".
  - e.g. A class in image processing library. 
- **Workflow**
  - A series of image processing using several ***components* to start with image data as input and outputs either processed image or numerical values.
  - e.g. a script
  - e.g. a detailed step-by-step instruction. 
- **Software / Library**
  - A package of components. 
- **Sample Data**
  - In general, sample image data. It could be none-image if needed. 
  - Uploaded image is strongly recommended to have details of the object in image, capture conditions e.g. microscope, objective, probe details, scale and so on.
  - Better be with explicit licensing condition. 

- Details on our current nomenclature is explained in [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZ_M8RIX8TZRh6sXA_h3lSO4cELey66Bwe6ISONMRlo/edit)

2584;;92;;ImageJ Bandpass filter;The Fourier transform of an image produces a representation in frequency space: i.e. separated according to spatial frequency (effectively scale). The 2D amplitude map of the different spatial frequencies is symmetrical, and is commonly displayed with low spatial frequencies (large features) in the centre, highest spatial frequencies (small features) at the edges.

Fourier filtering involves suppressing or enhancing features in the Fourier domain before carrying out an inverse Fourier transform to obtain a filtered real-space image. ImageJ's _Process > FFT > Bandpass Filter_ implements two common Fourier-filtering functions: 1. filtering for specific sizes of feature in an image by selecting minimum and maximum feature sizes (selecting a radial band of frequencies in Fourier space); 2. filtering out repetitive horizontal or vertical stripes by cutting out a zero-frequency stripe in the orthogonal direction in frequency space.

The example image above shows the effect of filtering for 2 feature size ranges: 0-8 pixels, and 8-256 pixels; where the former appears "flattened" or washed-out, and the latter very blurred. The small images displayed to the lower-right of each filtered image correspond to the mask applied to the Fourier transform. Such filtering can be useful prior to global thresholding, for noise suppression, etc.;Joachim Walter;;http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fft-filter.html;

2338;;11;;Centromere Recognition and Quantification;Particle detection is based on "Analyze Particles" in ImageJ. It probably could also be used in spot detection, not limited to centromere. 

>This macro is described in Bodor et al. (2012) Analysis of Protein Turnover by Quantitative SNAP-Based Pulse-Chase Imaging. Current Protocols in Cell Biology, UNIT 8.8. The macro recognizes centromere or kinetochore foci in Delta Vision or TIFF images and determines their centroid position. Fluorescent intensities are then measured for each centromere by placing a small box around the centroid position of the centromere. The peak intensity value within the box is corrected for local background by subtraction of the minimum pixel value. This process results in an accurate measurement of large numbers of centromere or kinetochore-specific signals.;A Great Guy;;;
2373;;92;;3D Object Segmentation and Tracking;In the commercial image analysis software "Volocity", automated Measurement protocols can be constructed by dragging, dropping and configuring a sequence of individual "tasks". By combining the "Find Objects" task with a subsequent "Track" task, 3D objects can be identified and followed over time. The initial "Find Objects" segmentation can be refined, e.g. using "Separate Touching Objects"; and tracking results in the form of "Measurement Items" can be viewed in tabular form, as a graph, etc.;A Great Guy;;;

2619;;11;;Recent crash and recovery;During the period between Feb 12 -15th, there was a serious clash that caused biii to become white out: nothing shown. 

This probably was due to complex of reasons: one obvious problem before it became so damaged, was that authentification settings for each pages were collapted, and white out happened after trying to fix this from the web interface. Updating the "allowed" actions in "node access" setting exhausted memory. 

But then by adding some lines in index.php to find out what is happening, memory exhaustion was occurring in biblio module. 

Turing off biblio module from drush using command

    drush dis biblio

Regain the page to appear in the web, but without biblio. When turned on, website again became whiteout. Memory always run out, with a warning

</blockquote>

To fix this last point, I added a line in biblio.module to print the database loading process. This allowed to pinpoint the problematic node, which is then deleted, and biblio recovered in the website. In fact, the memory run out because of infinite looping due to unknown reason for that node.

Software availability:
AVeMap was developed under MATLAB (MathWorks). It is available as an executable, multiplatform program, together with source codes and documentation at http://umr168.curie.fr/en/avemap, and the source code is also available as Supplementary Software. For practical reasons, this executable version, which does not require MATLAB, runs on a single processor. For users who want to customize the software and/or need the power of parallel computing, an installation of MATLAB with its 'parallel' and 'image processing' toolboxes is needed. Note that, even with the executable version, the velocity fields are stored for further analysis. The add-on AVeMap+ uses these AVeMap-computed velocity fields to generate heat map tables. It is available with the same link.;Maxime Deforet,	Maria Carla Parrini,	Laurence Petitjean,	Marco Biondini, Axel Buguin, Jacques Camonis,  Pascal Silberzan;;;

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Bioimaging is an interdisciplinary science. In addition to biology itself, a deep understanding of optics, microscopy, fluorescence probes, image processing and image analysis is required. Due to this overwhelming need of diverse technologies and since it is rather unlikely a single individual can master all these topics, biologists and imaging scientists need to work together to achieve higher scientific goals. In order to facilitate this collaborative process, a strengthening of the bioimaging infrastructure is required. In the following, we focus on the image processing and analysis in bioimaging. We first briefly review the current status of the infrastructure and then explain the need for actions to promote a higher accessibility to bioimage analysis for biological researchers.</p>

<p>Among the overall bioimaging workflow, image processing and analysis come at the very last end. Microscope images are multidimensional data representing complex biological phenomena that involve biochemical reactions occurring within three dimensional spatial contexts. The major task of image processing and analysis is to computationally decrease the dimensionality of the problem under study, extract relevant quantitative information and conduct statistical data analysis.</p>

<p>Compared to the other technologies involved in bioimaging, image processing and analysis is unique in that its infrastructure is essentially made of computational tools. Hardware such as server and client machines, data storages and networks are the physical infrastructure for computation but not the main focus of this meeting. In turn software and its intrinsic capability for simple dissemination is the main target.</p>

<p>To organize and increase  in a scalable way the accessibility to image processing and analysis infrastructure within the European bioimaging community, its heavy dependence on human resource should be given a considerable attention.</p>

<p>Software is a pure product of human imagination. Its availability is solely dependent on the effort of computational scientists and programmers who create algorithms and implement them. We call these individuals “developers”. They create image processing algorithms, design their efficient implementations allowing faster computations, and design graphical user interfaces to simplify the user interactions. The outcome of their efforts ranges from general algorithms that could be used as basis for many types of applications to specific solutions limited to certain biological phenomena. The developers are hence algorithm developers and programmers, but in many cases algorithm developers also take the role of programmers.</p>

<p>As the number of image processing / analysis software and the diversity of image processing / analysis algorithms grew, professional knowledge to combine multiple image processing libraries and tools to construct complex workflows has increasingly become important. For this assembly task, insights in biology, image processing, various computational libraries, computer programming languages and statistics are necessary. Former developers were in many cases taking this role simultaneously, but recently a community of professionals specialized in assembling tools for such customized tasks is growing. They are mostly biologists, engineers and physicists and we will call this new type of professionals “analysts”.</p>

<p>Existing software packages already make available a rich range of tools for processing and analysis of microscope images. They are however constantly evolving and the number of functions is steadily growing. With so many choices offered to the users, the problem to choose the best tool to answer a specific question is not trivial, and sometimes extremely complex. Many high end packages are open source and readily accessible but bridging that accessibility to a specific demand is missing. The enhancement and strengthening of an human network capable of boosting this optimization and allowing a better usage of the existing software through collaborations / consultations / teachings is equally important.
To organize and increase the accessibility to image processing and analysis infrastructure within the European bioimaging community in a scalable way, its heavy dependence on human resource itself should be given with a considerable attention.</p>

<p>For this reason, we briefly overview the activities of developers and analysts. To assess the future of these activities, career paths will also be examined.</p>

<h2>BioImage Community</h2>

<h3>Developers</h3>

<p>Image processing is a solid field where many algorithms have been developed to improve image quality, to extract features, to compress the information, to segment objects, to classify patterns, to track objects, to estimate model parameters in presence of noise and to interactively visualize the data. These advances have been made possible by the interactions between researchers in the field of signal processing, computer vision, mathematics, statistics, machine learning and computer science. Some of these researchers (developers) became specialized in treating microscope images in collaboration with biologists and contributed many software packages and tools (many are also lead by biologists).</p>

<p>These contributions can be seen in a glance in the webpage of the <a href="http://www.openbioimage.org/">Open Bio Image Alliance (OBIA)</a>, as well as the developer on-going gatherings.</p>

<p>Information exchange and human networks have been established through these meetings. The career path of developers inherits that of computer scientists and programmers. Computer scientists have their academic position in computer science, electrical engineering and signal processing departments or image processing position in biological / medical institutes. They publish their outcome of developments in computer science and signal processing journals as well as in biological journals as collaborators, which will be the credit for their scientific career.</p>

<h3>Analysts</h3>

<p>Analysts bridges the gap between developers and biologists. The gap exists since the demands of biologists could ultimately be summarized to "single click and does all". Such automation is possible for some trivial tasks but in many cases the complexity of modern Bioimage Analysis methods hinders the full automation. Every Bioimaging project is unique hence the image analysis, the final step of bioimaging, is also unique and cannot escape from some assembling and customizations. Here analysts come into play to create optimal protocols of image analysis.</p>

<p>In addition to customization of image analysis protocols, another major activity of most of analysts is teaching. Teaching of basics on image processing and analysis techniques shifts up the level of “Image Processing and Analysis literacy” in their belonging institute, which collectively has positive effect in promoting high-level image analysis in that local Bioimaging community.</p>

<p>The analyst is a new type of profession and their number is limited. The first precursory gathering of analysts took a form of course to teach image analysis to biologists in 2013 <a href="www.embl.de/bias2013">(EMBL Master Course on BioImage Data Analysis 2013, BIAS 2013)</a>. The prominent outcome of analysts working together was course textbooks written through collaborative editing and peer reviewing. Through this process, we learned creative ideas from others on how each has been solving various Bioimage Analysis problems. As each of us had been more-or-less working individually and locally, exchange of knowledge were highly valuable and enlightening.</p>

<p>The background of analysts is diverse: Physicists, Computer Scientists, Electrical Engineers, Physical Chemists and Biologists. There is no established career path for becoming analysts, but a need of diverse knowledge as stated already. Compared to developers who have conventional criteria for evaluating their careers, analysts are currently evaluated only by words of mouth. An increased visibility of the their work is required both for stabilizing this new career path and at the same time for the employers to evaluate candidates.</p>

<h3>Users</h3>

<p>Scientists, engineers or students who, in collaboration with analysts or developers, or independently, perform BioImage processing &amp; analysis to ultimately answer scientific questions or support scientific and technological development.</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>How could we increase the accessibility and diffusion of image processing / analysis infrastructures, especially in terms of software packages?</p>

<p>Existing software packages already offer a rich and wide range of tools for processing and analysis of microscope images. They are constantly evolving and the number of new functions is steadily growing. With so many options offered to users, the problem for them is now to choose the best tool that matches their needs. In other words, the accessibility is already excellent, but bridging this accessibility to a specific demand is missing. Moreover, the enhancement and strengthening of a human network that can boost the diffusion of the existing software through collaborations / consultations / teachings is equally important.</p>

<p>To overcome the imminent problem that exists as a gap between the availability of software tools and the difficulty of a specific choice, the flow of information could be smoothed from multiple angles. At the same time staging the role of “analysts” at the community level will be key. For these reasons, we propose the following actions:</p>

<h3>A Web Tool</h3>

<p>A list of links to software packages could be found in various sources, but from the user side this is not really practical because in actual research scenarios we want to find a specific function that matches the need regardless of the package in which it is contained. Many software packages are developed as a unit, so their documentations are monolithic. The list and associated documentations should become more functional rather than a one-dimensional listing of package names.</p>

<p>A web platform that integrates all  documentations should be created. It could decrease perpetual “reinventions of the wheel” and may at the same time channel the new developments towards truly innovative extensions. We call such user-oriented functional and highly interactive web platform as a “web tool” and propose the following specifications:</p>

<ol>
<li>One page per Function

<ol type="a">
<li>Users try to find functions based on their needs rather than by name of the software package. This means that each function (plugin, menu item) included in the software packages should be assigned a single documentation page, and ideally should not be categorized by package.</li>
<li>This is partially actualized in the Fiji project wiki page, where each contributed plugin features a page listing the name of the developer, the link to the source code and the usage instructions. This way of documentation should be extended to include all software packages and presented as single web document that offers higher accessibility to users.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Multiple tagging per Function

<ol type="a">
<li>A documentation page prepared for each function / modules / plugins / site-packages should have a tagging functionality. Tags are like keywords given to each page. Tags allow user to filter functions to find those that matches their needs.</li>
<li>Each page should be added with <strong>multiple tags</strong>.</li>
<li>Both developers and users should be able to create tags and add tags to any page.</li>
<li>There should be “tag administrators”, who control the tagging behaviors and also promotes the tagging. Administrators themselves should commit in active tagging.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Back-links to literature

<ol type="a">
<li>In general, papers that uses image processing and analysis mention the name of the package and function that they used. This is so to say, a <strong>forward link</strong> to the tools from papers.</li>
<li>Users often wants to know examples of usages. For this reason, having <strong>back-links</strong> to literature / Pubmed abstract page / websites using the function / tool is desirable so that users could be directed to actual example usages.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Comments from users

<ol type="a">
<li>A comment section should be added to each page so that any discussions / claims / questions could be viewed by other users.</li>
<li>There could be further added with the aggregation of mailing list discussions (text scrapings).</li>
<li>Access permissions (need more opinions on this issue):</li>
<li>Similar to ‘Trip advisor’ (maybe hard to actualize), each function could feature a users’ and developers’ opinion chart together with the comments, about the various implementations of a function in different software packages or about the effectiveness of a function for a certain goal/analysis. So this is similar to a point developed above, but here the question is to discuss and decide whether to include a door for users to comment on the functions and their ease-of-use. Without an interactive access by users, the Wiki would lose the ‘wiki property’ which we look forward to developing, and could quickly be seen as a restricted portal where only a handful of developers can emit judgements. Obviously the comments page could be moderated by the developer and by other users with voting (‘like it’ / ‘don’t like it’).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>sample datasets

<ol type="a">
<li>Links to sample datasets should be added to each page, so that user can try out the function and get a a feeling about the output to expect. As it is often difficult to know the limit of the functionality of tools, sample images will be a good reference.</li>
<li>If possible, data storage and uploading features could be added. Then the sample data could be directly uploaded by taggers for users to test, evaluate and compare.</li>
<li>When applicable ‘ground truth’ (expected) results of the function should ideally be added with each sample dataset.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>A large part of the web tool should be edited manually. We propose a <strong>“taggathon”</strong> once the web tool proposed here becomes available. In this event, developers, analysts and users gather in one place and concentrate on tagging pages, back linking literature and adding documentation to each page.</p>

<h3>Meetings</h3>

<p>Meeting will be a place to collectively spread and absorb image processing and analysis activities. In terms of increasing the software packages / tools accessibility, three different types of meetings should be organized with clearly defined target groups (developers, analysts and users) and directed flow of information between these groups. As a byproduct meetings strengthen human networks that trigger individual communication to be smoother and more informal, which allows specific solutions to problems by connecting developers, analysts and users. We include teaching oriented activities, or courses, as meetings since although the format differs, we think that the functionality is common in terms of increasing the accessibility to software packages.</p>

<h4>“Show Case” meetings (Developers and Analysts)</h4>

<p>Software packages upgrade on daily basis and it is quite an effort to follow changes and new functions. An annual meeting with presentations explaining upgrades given by a developer from each software packages would be a great benefit for analysts to be updated with the latest changes. We call this a  “Show Case” meeting. In the same meeting, analysis would provide feed-backs by showing their usages, explaining merits and demerits of the software package and also to request missing functionalities. This meeting also invites prominent developers who are creating cutting edge algorithms so that the progress in the front line of image processing could also be known to developers and to analysts.</p>

<h4>Image Analysis Courses (Analysts and Users)</h4>

<p>In image analysis courses, analysts teach users on how to combine various tools to tackle practical problems, in order to narrow  the gap between software packages and user’s demands by increasing the image analysis literacy of users. The BIAS 2013 course could be a template for such courses.</p>

<p>Several outcomes will be expected from this activity. The first is that users become more fluent with image analysis, which heightens their ability to choose and assemble appropriate tools. The second is that analysts learn from other analysts how they solved some specific problems and also possibly get aware of new problems they might be expected to solve in the future. The third is that by working together the community of analysts becomes strengthened, leading to an increase in lateral communications.</p>

<p>Courses could target two different types of user group: the first group is graduate students, postdocs and research scientists. The teaching aims that they could reach a level to do basic analysis on their own. The second group is microscope facility staffs. As analysts are still missing in many places, microscope facility staffs are taking the role of analysts beside the maintenance of microscopes. For this group of people the course teaches more advanced contents and also provides and assists teaching in their own institutes (Meta-teaching).</p>

<h4>General Assembly (Developers, Analysts, Users)</h4>

<p>A general assembly is a gathering of all developers, analysts and users. During this gathering, hackathon, presentations and courses happen in parallel. This is because there are difference in interests among three different groups, but information flow between these groups could be efficiently increased by gathering at the same place. Analysts could teach users, and users could present their work and show how developers products are used, developers could report updates on their tools and libraries. In parallel the developers and analysts could also sit together in a hackathon to extend the tools. Analysts form the most capable group of people to feedback the developers with usages. More details on the merits and demerits of the general assembly could be further discussed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developers sometimes go out from hackathon and give talks about their works. Discuss with analysts.

<ul>
<li>Hackathons are in many cases locally funded or in worst cases developers pay themselves. There should be more official support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Analysts teach and also take a part in the Hackathon (when they are not teaching). Discuss with developers on the usages.</li>
<li>Users acquire a deep knowledge on usage of tools from the developer talks. Also being taught  practical strategies from analysts. Users present their work.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Open Textbooks for BioImage Analysis</h3>

<p>A significant problem of image analysis in biology is the lack of textbooks. For image processing, there are many textbooks written by computer scientists. These textbooks are extremely valuable as they explain the users the theory behind image processing algorithms and how they are working. However, these textbooks cover only a part of the task of image analysis in biology. In addition to image processing algorithms, bioimage analysis requires knowledge on what could be measured and how to measure biological images, but this part does not exist as textbook. This aspect of bioimage analysis is supposed to fulfill in biology a role similar to that of analytical chemistry in chemistry. As it has been missing, it turned out to be the fundamental reason for this growing gap between image processing software and user’s demands.</p>

<p>To fill this gap, analysts are at work interactively to bridge biologist’s demands and the image processing world, but their work should be organized as textbooks for efficient and systematic propagation of knowledge and techniques. As a start-up BIAS 2013 course prepared original textbooks to cover the gaps and to solve the fundamental problem in the accessibility to the image processing and analysis infrastructure. The writing of these textbooks could be standardized and the textbooks published as open textbooks to provide valuable and systematic information to biologists. At the same time, the publishing of the textbooks gives a firm scientific credit to analysts, secure their activity and pave the newly appearing career path, which may further attract more people to commit in this direction.</p>

<h3>Further Actions to be considered</h3>

<p>Following is a list of actions not explained in the previous text but which will be considered in future.</p>

<ol>
<li>For interoperability, define a standard platform (could be ImageJ, Python, Icy or any other). The platform does not have to be unique but it would be good that these platforms support multiple language bindings “from scratch” (such as Python) and that the pool of functions (plugins) that is written can easily be included to any of the platforms.</li>
<li>As a roadmap, a list of algorithms “to be implemented” could be prepared based on their relevance.</li>
<li>Set up a framework for algorithm evaluation with ground truth images, these datasets could also be used as example datasets.</li>
</ol>

Quote from the plugin page:

>LineageTracker offers an ImageJ based framework which is easily extendible and has the capability to track cell lineages while being specifically designed to handle large cell displacements between frames. The methods are designed for fluorescent cells and have been used to analyse Schizosaccharomyces pombe, C2C12 mouse stem cells or migrating RPE cells.

This tool also allows flexible cell segmentation and extendable in all aspects. The webpage is detailed with usage from ImageJ macro. Rather than being simply a component, the plugin is indeed a framework with set of components.   

## Misc info

A tip from the plugin author in ImageJ mailing list (08.Sep.2015): 

> We have an additional script to export only a selected range of frames. I can send you that if you think LineageTracker is something for you.
To be on the safe side I would try it with an older version of ImageJ. We have experienced some problems, mostly related to Java. Java 8 seems to fix most of it.

2544;;93;;idTracker: Tracking animals;<blockquote>idTracker is a videotracking software that keeps the correct identity of each individual during the whole video. It works for many animal species including mice, insects (Drosophila, ants) and fish (zebrafish, medaka, stickleback). idTracker distinguishes animals even when humans cannot, such as for size-matched siblings, and reidentifies animals after they temporarily disappear from view or across different videos. It is robust, easy to use and general.</blockquote> Technique details and analyses of several applications are described in <bib>2607</bib>.

2633;;11;;Advanced Form Block Patching;[Advanced Form Block](https://www.drupal.org/project/afb) was recently updated, and I had to patch this module again for associating tag-editing block with its belonging node. 

The patch is:

2361;;138;;Multi Kymograph;This macro and plugins suite for ImageJ (and Fiji) serves to measure velocity of moving structures and visualize them, from image time series (2D over time).
The module can be installed in imageJ as a Macro Menu and each function/component can be called separately. 
The full workflow consists in calling some, or all, the functions sequentially in order to get from the image preparation (e.g. filtering and visualization of tracks) to the production of the kymographs (time vs. distance plot) and their analysis (retrieving the velocities).
Here is the full workflow sequence:

- Load image sequence
- Crop and time-filter the image sequence ("Walking average" plugin)
- Generate tracks by z-projection ("Stack difference" plugin) 
- Select tracks and restore them in the original stack.
- execute plugin "multiple kymograph"
- Analyse: select edges of moving tracks graphically and quantify movement in a table.

input:   8-bit, 16-bit stacks, 2D in time. Calibrated is better for meaningful velocity measurements.
ouput:  the kymograph image, the velocity measurements tables.
requires imagej version: 1.33.n minimum.

Example of applications: velocity of moving objects/ strutures with sharp edges, incl.
velocity of microtubules (and their plus ends),
velocity of vesicles or particles along a 2D path,
velocity of migration of the edge of a cell or a multicellular group, 
retraction velocity of contractile bundles (e.g. actin fibers) or multicellular tissues after mechanical disruption (e.g. laser surgery)

2583;2583;92;;PRIISM/IVE;Priism is an image processing, analysis and visualisation application for multidimensional light and electron microscopy data. It uses the Image Visualization Environment (IVE) library, which is a closed-source C library with documented C and FORTRAN APIs. Priism/IVE was developed at UCSF, and can be obtained free of charge by sending an email request to the developers.

Many of the same processing and analysis functions available in other image processing applications can be found here (cropping, resizing, spatial filters, Fourier transforms, segmentation etc.), and it includes a comprehensive html-based offline manual.

A video tutorial is available (be careful of sounds, the video automatically starts!): [Sample Drift Correction Following 4D Confocal Time-lapse Imaging](http://www.jove.com/video/51086/sample-drift-correction-following-4d-confocal-time-lapse-imaging); Albert Cardona and Robert Bryson-Richardson;;http://fiji.sc/Correct_3D_drift;
2536;;137;;Measure cell volume over time;The workflow describes a solution to measure growth of cells in 3D. 

The sample dataset (part of the github repository) contains 2-Photon images of neurons. The neurons are imaged in 3D at two timeframes.To be able to measure significant differences in cell volume, the time gap of the frames is huge (ca. 30 min) and the animal was removed in the waiting phase. Thus, there is significant shift between the frames that has to be corrected before cell detection and tracking.  

The worflow consists of following steps:

1. Import of single tiff slices [imageJ macro]
2. Organizing the data in a 4D time series with 2 time frames [imageJ macro]
3. Correction of shift between the time frames by rigid registration [imagJ macro]
4. Bleaching correction [imageJ macro]
5. Export of preprocessed image data in ics/ids format [imageJ macro]

6. Import of ics/ids data to Imaris [Imaris]
7. Cell object detection as "Imaris Surface Object" [Imaris]
8. Tracking cell objects over time [Imaris]
9. Split Tracks (use Imaris XT extension "Split Tracks") to generate single cell objects [Imaris]
10. Export the statistics: Select the complete folder, go to the statistics tab and use ‚Full Export’ [Imaris]

2346;;11;;How to add a component / workflow page;Before adding a tool/function/implementations/scripts, you should decide if it is a **component or workflow**. If you are not sure with these terms, [please first read here.](http://biii.info/HowTo). A collection of components, without specific workflow, is called **software** including library. 

## To add a component page:

Component page is for 

- a menu item in GUI (such as plugin, e.g. "ManualTracking" in Fiji) 
- a single command in CUI (e.g. r.watershed in R)

2641;2641;566;;Cytomine;Cytomine is a rich internet application using modern web and distributed technologies (Grails, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Docker), databases (spatial SQL and NoSQL), and machine learning (tree-based approaches with random subwindows) to foster active and distributed collaboration and ease large-scale image exploitation. 

It provides remote and collaborative principles, rely on data models that allow to easily organize and semantically annotate imaging datasets in a standardized way (using user-defined ontologies associated to regions of interest),
efficiently support high-resolution multi-gigapixel images (incl. major digital scanner image formats), and provide mechanisms to readily proofread and share image quantifications produced by any image recognition algorithms. 
By emphasizing collaborative principles, the aim of Cytomine is to accelerate scientific progress and to significantly promote image data accessibility and reusability. Cytomine allows to break common practices in this domain where imaging datasets,
quantification results, and associated knowledge are still often stored and analyzed within the restricted circle of a specific laboratory.

This software is e.g. being used by life scientists to help them better evaluate drug treatments or understand biological processes directly from whole-slide tissue images, by pathologists to share and ease their diagnosis, and by teachers and students for pathology training purposes.;Raphaël Marée, Loïc Rollus, Benjamin Stévens, Renaud Hoyoux, Gilles Louppe, Rémy Vandaele, Jean-Michel Begon, Philipp Kainz, Pierre Geurts and Louis Wehenkel;;http://www.cytomine.be/;
2275;2275;2;;ilastik;<p>ilastik (the image learning, analysis, and segmentation toolkit) provides non-experts with a menu of pre-built image analysis workflows.  ilastik handles data of up to five dimensions (time, 3D space, and spectral dimension).  Its workflows provide an interactive experience to give the user immediate feedback on the quality of the results yielded by her chosen parameters and/or labelings.  The most commonly used workflow is pixel classification, which requires very little parameter tuning and instead offers a machine learning technique for segmenting an image based on local image features computed for each pixel.</p>

<p>Other workflows include:
<ul>
<li>Object classification: Similar to pixel classification, but classifies previously segmented objects instead of making pixel-wise decisions</li>
<li>Carving: Semi-automated segmentation of 3D objects (e.g. neurons) based on user-provided seeds</li>
<li>Manual Tracking: Semi-automated cell tracking of 2D+time or 3D+time images based on manual annotations</li>
<li>Automated tracking: Fully-automated cell tracking of 2D+time or 3D+time images with some parameter tuning</li>
<li>Density Counting: Learned cell population counting based on interactively provided user annotation</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Strengths:</b> interactive, simple interface (for non-experts), few parameters, larger-than-RAM data, multi-dimensional data (time, 3D space, channel), headless operation, batch mode, parallelized computation, open source</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Pre-built workflows (not reconfigurable), no plugin system, visualization sometimes buggy, must import 3D data to HDF5, tracking requires an external CPLEX installation</p>

1664;;0;;PureDenoise;Outline
The incessant development of improved microscopy imaging techniques, as well as the advent of highly selective fluorescent dyes has made possible the precise identification of tagged molecules in almost any biological specimen. Of particular interest are the visualization and the study of living cells, which induce tight constraints on the imaging process. To avoid the alteration of the sample and to achieve a high temporal resolution, low fluorophore concentrations, low-power illumination and short exposure time need to be used in practice. Such restrictions have a tremendous impact on the image quality. This is why we have recently introduced a new method, coined PURE-LET [1,2,3], for efficient, fast, and automatic denoising of multidimensional fluorescence microscopy images.;;;http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms/denoise/;
2382;;470;;Analyzing ER, PR, and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry;ImmunoRatio is an ImageJ plugin to quantify haematoxylin and DAB-stained tissue sections by measuring the percentage of positively stained nuclear area (labeling index), described in [bib]2452[/bib].

Notes for use:

* It is important to read the URL instructions and original paper to understand what is being measured.  In particular, the primary measurement made is *percentage of the total nuclear area*, not the *percentage of detected nuclei* (the latter being the more common method of assessing e.g. Ki67).  This may be further modified by the 'Result correction equation'.
* Ultimately ImmunoRatio relies on thresholding (color deconvolved [bib]2451[/bib]) images to define 'nucleus' vs 'non-nucleus' regions according to staining intensity.  Therefore dark artefacts, such as tissue folds, are likely to cause errors.
* The pixel size is not read automatically from the image, but rather the *source image scale* should be entered into the dialog box - and the image rescaled accordingly prior to analysis. This scale value is the *inverse* of the value normally found for *pixel width* and *pixel height* under *Image -> Properties...* (i.e. pixel width & height are given in microns per pixel; the dialog box asks for pixels per micron).;Vilppu Tuominen & Jorma Isola;;;
2648;;591;;iterative closest point registration;The ICP algorithm takes two point clouds as an input and return the rigid transformation (rotation matrix R and translation vector T), that best aligns the point clouds.

Example:
[R,T] = icp(q,p,10);

Aligns the points of p to the points q with 10 iterations of the algorithm.
The transformation is then applied using
R*p + repmat(T,1,length(p));

2643;2643;587;;SR-Tesseler;Localization-based super-resolution techniques open the door to unprecedented analysis of molecular organization. This task often involves complex image processing adapted to the specific topology and quality of the image to be analyzed.

SR-Tesseler <bib>2661</bib> is an open-source segmentation software using Voronoï tessellation constructed from the coordinates of localized molecules. It allows precise, robust and automatic quantification of protein organization at different scales, from the cellular level down to clusters of a few fluorescent markers.

SR-Tesseler is insensitive to cell shape, molecular organization, background and noise, allowing comparing efficiently different biological conditions in a non-biased manner, and perform quantifications on various proteins and cell types.

SR-Tesseler software comes with a very simple and intuitive graphical user interface, providing direct visual feedback of the results and is freely available under GPLv3 license.;Florian Levet, Jean-Baptiste Sibarita;;http://www.iins.u-bordeaux.fr/team-sibarita-SR-Tesseler;

2664;;85;;classification of hemp fibers based on morphological features;In this workflow, you can use MorphoLibJ to generate accurate morphometric measurements  


- First the fibers are segmented by mathematical morphology: for example by using MorphoLibJ:   


   Create a marker image by creating a rough mask with extended regional maxima (similar to Find Max), such that you have one max per fiber   
   Use the marker controlled watershed (in MorpholLibJ/ Segentation/ marker controlled watershed) : indicate the orginal grayscale image as the input, Marker will e your maxima image, select None for mask   
it will create a label mask of your fibers     


- In MorphoLibJ /A analyze/ select Region Morphometry: this will compute different shape factors which are more robust than the ones implemented by default in ImageJ    

  
- Export the result table created to a csv file       


- Then for example in Matlab or R, you can apply a PCA analysis (Principal component analysis) followed by a k-means with the number of class (clusters) (different fibers type) you want to separate.    


- You can then add this class as a new feature to your csv file.   

         
- From this you can sort your labelled fibers into these clusters for a visual feedback or further spatial analysis

2651;;469;;Tutorial about MorphoLibJ: using morphological reconstructions to isolate objects;When trying to isolate objects, one strategy might be to use regular morphological operations (opening/closing) to remove small objects that are not of interest.
In case small objects are made of a large number of pixels, this operation might impair the remaining objects' contours.
Alternative strategy might be to use morphological reconstruction. In short, seed are placed on the image, on objects, then conditionnal dilation is performed from those seeds.

Here is how to proceed, using MorphoLibJ:

* Open an image
* Use the multi-point selection tool and place seeds on objects of interest
* Create a new image of same size, black background
* Transfer the selection to the new image (Edit/Selection/Restore selection)
* Draw (make sure you're using white foreground) the multiple point selection
* Launch the  Morphological reconstruction plugin: Plugins/MorphoLibJ/Morphological reconstruction

The output will be both a curve of the remaining content of the image against the growing size of the structuring element, and the corresponding results table that could be then exported. 
It can deal with grayscale images directly, no need to segment the image first.
This plugin can then be used to compare different texture based on some statistical analysis of the produced curve (for exemple comparison of the geometrical means to discriminate 2 textures).
It is macro recordable as well.

* Optimal filament segmentation of 2D images with previously unknown number of filaments. It can produce sub-pixel accuracy results and handle different types of image data from different microscopy modalities. 
* Curvature filters for image filtering, denoising, and restoration. Currently implemented Gauss curvature, Mean curvature, and Total Variation (TV) filters. The only parameters is the number of iterations, i.e., how many passes of the filter should be applied to the image. Else the filters are parameter free. A C++ implementation of these filters is also available. 
* Image naturalization for image enhancement based on gradient statistics of natural-scence images. The algorithm is completely parameter free. In fluorescence microscopy, image naturalization can be used for blind deconvolution, dehazing (removing scatter light), denoising, or contract enhancement. 
*Tool for automatically send and distribute jobs on clusters and get back the results. 
* Multi-region image segmentation of 2D and 3D images without needing to know the number of regions beforehand. The method can handle objects with internal intensity gradients (i.e., shaded objects), but is limited to pixel-level accuracy and only delivers locally optimal results that depend on the initialization.
* Squassh for globally optimal segmentation of piecewise constant regions in 2D and 3D images and for object-based co-localization analysis. Globally optimal segmentation is very fast and independent of initialization, but it is currently limited to objects with homogeneous (i.e., constant) internal intensity. The method can also produce sub-pixel accurate results.
* Tool for inferring spatial interactions between patterns of objects in images or between coordinates read from a file.
* Tool for robust, histogram-based background subtraction well suited to correct for inhomogeneous illumination artifacts.
* This plugin can be used to estimate the Point-Spread Function of the microscopy out of 2D fluorescence images.
* Measurement of the 3D Point-Spread Function of a confocal microscope from an image stack.
* It can add synthetic Poisson-distributed noise to an image in order to simulate shot noise of various signal-to-noise ratios. It can be used to generate benchmark images in order to assess the accuracy and robustness of image processing algorithms as a function of the noise level present in images. 
* This plugin convolves an image with a Bessel function in order to simulate imaging with a microscope. The Bessel function is a model for a generic Point-Spread Function, depending on the wavelength and NA. This plugin can be used to generate synthetic images that mimic microscope output in order to benchmark the accuracy and robustness of image processing algorithms.
* Small utility to detect bright spots in images and estimate their center. This can be handy in an image-processing pipeline or macro where only detection is needed. It can also be combined with Squash for segmentation patch positioning, and it handles time-series and video data.
*  An utility to create manual segmentations to be used as ground truth to test and benchmark automatic segmentation algorithms.
* A tool for replacing one color in an image with another color.

Balanced SOFI analyses several cumulant orders for extracting molecular parameter maps, such as the bright and dark state lifetimes, the concentration and the brightness distributions of fluorophores within biological samples [a]. In combination with a deconvolution of the cumulant images, the estimated parameter maps proved useful to balance the image contrast and to linearize the brightness and blinking response.

2716;;85;;Microscope Image Correlation Spectroscopy MICS;Fluorescence spectroscopy by image correlation is a technique that allows analysing and characterizing the different molecular dynamics from a sequence of fluorescence images.

Many image correlation techniques have been developed for different applications but in particular to study the mechanisms of cell adhesion during migration. These techniques can be used with most imaging modalities: e.g. fluorescence widefield, confocal microscopy, TIRFM. They allow to obtain information such as the density in molecules, diffusion coefficients, the presence of several populations, or the direction and speed of a movement corresponding to active transport when spatial and temporal correlations are taken into account (STICS: Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy). 
Please see <bib>2580</bib>  for a review and the description of the methods.

This plugin is based on ICS_tools plugin by Fitz Elliott, available [here](http://www.cellmigration.org/resource/imaging/imaging_resources.shtml "cell migration website").

Some bugs have been removed, ROI does not need to be squared, fitting is weighted in order to give more weight to the smaller lags (temporal or spatial)
Exemple of use on sample data [fluorescent beads](http://biii.info/node/2577 "Beads")
- Select an ROI, start by ICS to get the right PSF size
- Then run TICS and select diffusion, or diffusion plus flow model. Remove the first line (autocorrelation) which corresponds to the noise autocorrelation before fitting.

2721;2721;93;;TurtleSeg: 3D Image Segmentation Software;TurtleSeg is an interactive 3D image segmentation tool. TurtleSeg has an automated system, Spotlight, for automatically directing the user towards the next steps. Typically, a user loads a 3D image and then manually contour a sparse number of slices, the full 3D segmentation can then be built automatically.;;;http://www.turtleseg.org/;

Quote from the ImageJ reference page: Splits the image by lines of points having equal distance to the borders of the two nearest particles. Thus, the Voronoi cell of each particle includes all points that are nearer to this particle than any other particle. When particles are single points, this process is a Voronoi tessellation (also known as Dirichlet tessellation).  
The output type (Overwrite, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit) of this command can be set in the Process?Binary?Options…? dialog box. In the output, the value inside the Voronoi cells is zero; the pixel values of the dividing lines between the cells are equal to the distance between the two nearest particles. This is similar to a medial axis transform of the background, but there are no lines in inner holes of particles.;Wayne Rasband, Michael Schmid;;https://github.com/imagej/imagej1/blob/master/ij/plugin/filter/EDM.java;

2201;;0;;Squassh;‘’’Squassh’’’ is a tool for 2D and 3D segmentation and quantification of subcellular shapes in fluorescence microscopy images. It provides globally optimal detection and segmentation of objects with constant internal intensity distribution, followed by object-based colocalization analysis. The segmentation computed by Region Competition can optionally correct for the PSF of the microscope, hence providing optimally deconvolved segmentations.

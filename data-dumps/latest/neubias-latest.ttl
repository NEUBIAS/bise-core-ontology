Marker-controlled Watershed needs at least two images to run:\r
    The Input image: a 2D or 3D grayscale image to flood, usually the gradient of an image.\r
    The Marker image: an image of the same dimensions as the input containing the seed points or markers as connected regions of voxels, each of them with a different label. They correspond usually to the local minima of the input image, but they can be set arbitrarily.\r
And it can optionally admit a third image:\r
    The Mask image: a binary image of the same dimensions as input and marker which can be used to restrict the areas of application of the algorithm. Set to "None" to run the method on the whole input image.\r

Many image correlation techniques have been developed for different applications but in particular to study the mechanisms of cell adhesion during migration. These techniques can be used with most imaging modalities: e.g. fluorescence widefield, confocal microscopy, TIRFM. They allow to obtain information such as the density in molecules, diffusion coefficients, the presence of several populations, or the direction and speed of a movement corresponding to active transport when spatial and temporal correlations are taken into account (STICS: Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy). Please see 2580 for a review and the description of the methods. This plugin is based on ICS_tools plugin by Fitz Elliott, available [here](http://www.cellmigration.org/resource/imaging/imaging_resources.shtml "cell migration website"). Some bugs have been removed, ROI does not need to be squared, fitting is weighted in order to give more weight to the smaller lags (temporal or spatial) Exemple of use on sample data [fluorescent beads](http://biii.info/node/2577 "Beads") - Select an ROI, start by ICS to get the right PSF size - Then run TICS and select diffusion, or diffusion plus flow model.

The 2D amplitude map of the different spatial frequencies is symmetrical, and is commonly displayed with low spatial frequencies (large features) in the centre, highest spatial frequencies (small features) at the edges. Fourier filtering involves suppressing or enhancing features in the Fourier domain before carrying out an inverse Fourier transform to obtain a filtered real-space image. ImageJ's _Process &gt; FFT &gt; Bandpass Filter_ implements two common Fourier-filtering functions: 1. filtering for specific sizes of feature in an image by selecting minimum and maximum feature sizes (selecting a radial band of frequencies in Fourier space); 2. filtering out repetitive horizontal or vertical stripes by cutting out a zero-frequency stripe in the orthogonal direction in frequency space. The example image above shows the effect of filtering for 2 feature size ranges: 0-8 pixels, and 8-256 pixels; where the former appears "flattened" or washed-out, and the latter very blurred. The small images displayed to the lower-right of each filtered image correspond to the mask applied to the Fourier transform. Such filtering can be useful prior to global thresholding, for noise suppression, etc.</p>\r

\r
Quote from the plugin page:\r
\r
>LineageTracker offers an ImageJ based framework which is easily extendible and has the capability to track cell lineages while being specifically designed to handle large cell displacements between frames. The methods are designed for fluorescent cells and have been used to analyse Schizosaccharomyces pombe, C2C12 mouse stem cells or migrating RPE cells.\r
\r
This tool also allows flexible cell segmentation and extendable in all aspects. The webpage is detailed with usage from ImageJ macro. Rather than being simply a component, the plugin is indeed a framework with set of components.   \r
\r
## Misc info\r
\r
A tip from the plugin author in ImageJ mailing list (08.Sep.2015): \r
\r
> We have an additional script to export only a selected range of frames. I can send you that if you think LineageTracker is something for you.\r
To be on the safe side I would try it with an older version of ImageJ. We have experienced some problems, mostly related to Java. Java 8 seems to fix most of it.\r

* 2D/3D single-particle tracking tool which can be used to track bright spots in 2D/3D movies over time.\r
* Optimal filament segmentation of 2D images with previously unknown number of filaments. It can produce sub-pixel accuracy results and handle different types of image data from different microscopy modalities. \r
* Curvature filters for image filtering, denoising, and restoration. Currently implemented Gauss curvature, Mean curvature, and Total Variation (TV) filters. The only parameters is the number of iterations, i.e., how many passes of the filter should be applied to the image. Else the filters are parameter free. A C++ implementation of these filters is also available. \r
* Image naturalization for image enhancement based on gradient statistics of natural-scence images. The algorithm is completely parameter free. In fluorescence microscopy, image naturalization can be used for blind deconvolution, dehazing (removing scatter light), denoising, or contract enhancement. \r
*Tool for automatically send and distribute jobs on clusters and get back the results. \r
* Multi-region image segmentation of 2D and 3D images without needing to know the number of regions beforehand. The method can handle objects with internal intensity gradients (i.e., shaded objects), but is limited to pixel-level accuracy and only delivers locally optimal results that depend on the initialization.\r
* Squassh for globally optimal segmentation of piecewise constant regions in 2D and 3D images and for object-based co-localization analysis. Globally optimal segmentation is very fast and independent of initialization, but it is currently limited to objects with homogeneous (i.e., constant) internal intensity. The method can also produce sub-pixel accurate results.\r
* Tool for inferring spatial interactions between patterns of objects in images or between coordinates read from a file.\r
* Tool for robust, histogram-based background subtraction well suited to correct for inhomogeneous illumination artifacts.\r
* This plugin can be used to estimate the Point-Spread Function of the microscopy out of 2D fluorescence images.\r
* Measurement of the 3D Point-Spread Function of a confocal microscope from an image stack.\r
* It can add synthetic Poisson-distributed noise to an image in order to simulate shot noise of various signal-to-noise ratios. It can be used to generate benchmark images in order to assess the accuracy and robustness of image processing algorithms as a function of the noise level present in images. \r
* This plugin convolves an image with a Bessel function in order to simulate imaging with a microscope. The Bessel function is a model for a generic Point-Spread Function, depending on the wavelength and NA. This plugin can be used to generate synthetic images that mimic microscope output in order to benchmark the accuracy and robustness of image processing algorithms.\r
* Small utility to detect bright spots in images and estimate their center. This can be handy in an image-processing pipeline or macro where only detection is needed. It can also be combined with Squash for segmentation patch positioning, and it handles time-series and video data.\r
*  An utility to create manual segmentations to be used as ground truth to test and benchmark automatic segmentation algorithms.\r
* A tool for replacing one color in an image with another color. \r

It is designed to navigate, share and collaboratively annotate massive image data sets of biological specimens. The interface is inspired by GoogleMaps, with which it shares basic navigation concepts, enhanced to allow the exploration of 3D biological image data acquired by optical or physical sectioning microscopy techniques. The interface enables seamless sharing of regions of interest through bookmarks and synchronized navigation through multiple registered data sets. With massive biological image data sets it is unrealistic to create a sustainable centralized repository. A unique feature of CATMAID is its partially decentralized architecture where the presented image data can reside on any Internet accessible server and yet can be easily cross-referenced in the central database. In this way no image data are duplicated and the data producers retain full control over their images. CATMAID is intended to serve as data sharing platform for biologists using high-resolution imaging techniques to probe large specimens. Any high-throughput, high-content imaging project such as gene expression pattern screens would benefit from the interface for data sharing and annotation.</p>\r

The 3D neuronal structure is then constructed from the 2D skeletons. Biologists tend to use confocal microscopes for optimal images in a slice for human visualization; and images in two consecutive slices contain overlapped information. Consequently, a spherical object becomes oval in the image stack; that is, neurons in the image stack do not reflect the true shape of the neuron. This is the main reason we chose not to work directly on the 3D volume.</p>\r
\r
<p>The proposed method comprises two steps. The first is the image processing step, which involves computing a set of voxels that is a superset of the 3D centerlines of the neuron. The shortest path graph algorithm then computes the centerlines. The proposed method was applied to process more than 16 000 neurons. By using a large amount of reconstructions, this study also demonstrated a result derived from the reconstructed data using the clustering technique."

Then, DF-Tracing executes a coupled distance-field (DF) algorithm on the extracted foreground neurite signal and reconstructs the neuron morphology automatically. Two distance-transform based “force” fields are used: one for “pressure”, which is the distance transform field of foreground pixels (voxels) to the background, and another for “thrust”, which is the distance transform field of the foreground pixels to an automatically determined seed point. The coupling of these two force fields can“push” a “rolling ball” quickly along the skeleton of a neuron, reconstructing the 3D cell morphology.</p>\r

\r
<p>Whole brain tissue slices are commonly used in neurobiological research for analyzing pathological features in an anatomically defined manner. However, since many pathologies are expressed in specific regions of the brain, it is necessary to have an annotation of the regions in the brain slices. Such an annotation can be done by manual delineation, as done most often, or by an automated region annotation tool.</p>\r
\r
<p>SliceMap is a FIJI/ImageJ plugin for automated brain region annotation of fluorescent brain slices. The plugin uses a reference library of pre-annotated brain slices (the brain region templates) to annotate brain regions of unknown samples. To perform the region annotation, SliceMap registers the reference slices to the sample slice (using elastic registration plugin BUnwarpJ) and uses the resulting image transformations to morph the template regions towards the anatomical brain regions of the sample. The resulting brain regions are saved as FIJI/ImageJ ROI’s (Regions Of Interest) as a single zip-file for each sample slice.</p>\r

- Select tracks and restore them in the original stack.\r

* Stain colors depend on numerous factors, such as the precise stains and scanner; therefore, the 'default' stain vectors (used to define the colors) are unlikely to be optimal and may be very inaccurate.  See the URL instructions for how to create new stain vectors.\r

Note, the pixel values provided by this plugin are 8-bit and **not** equivalent to 'optical densities' frequently presented in the literature.\r

Color deconvolution is particularly helpful in separating stains so that stained regions can be detected (e.g. by setting a threshold), and then the number or areas of stained structures may be quantified.  Two potential approaches would be:\r

* It is important to read the URL instructions and original paper to understand what is being measured.

\r
Quantify the length of microtubules (MT) and the MT average density per cell. \r

### Workflow descriptions\r
\r
Simple two step workflow, allowing visual & manual correction of microtubule between the 2 steps. Batch measurement of microtubule lengths for multiple images is achieved by segmenting the MTs and then their skeletonizations.  The number of pixels in the microtubule is proportional to their length, so the length can be estimated.\r
\r
### Script\r
\r
Workflow is written as an ImageJ macro (Fiji) with following steps:\r
\r
1. The enhancement of tubular structure by computing eigenvalues of the hessian matrix on a Gaussian filtered version of the image ( sigma 1 pixel), as implemented in the tubeness plugin. \r
2. The tubules were then thresholded , and structures containing less than 3 pixels were discarded. \r
3. If needed, a visual check and correction of segmented microtubule is then performed.  \r
4. After correction, segmented MTs were then reduced to a 1-pixel thick line using the skeletonize plugin of Fiji.  The length of the skeletonized microtubules was then directly proportional to their length. \r
5. Data were grouped by condition and converted back to micrometers units under Matlab for the statistical tests.\r

#### Pitfalls\r

A 10x10 pattern of spots was detected by averaging rows and columns to produce horizontal and vertical profiles. Periodicity was determined automatically by autocorrelation and used to form an optimal length filter for morphological background removal. A rectangular grid of bounding boxes was defined. Each spot was individually addressed and segmented by thresholding to form a mask. The mask was used to isolate each spot from surrounding background. Individual spot intensity was determined by integrating pixel intensities. Finally, integrated intensities were tabulated and saved to a data file for subsequent statistical analysis to determine which genes matter most.</p>\r

\r
### Dependencies\r
\r
Following plugins are required.  \r
\r
1. [JAR to be placed under IJ plugin directory](http://xfer.curie.fr/get/192esfJKxA1/Trackingv2.0.zip)\r
  1. A pdf file with instructions and output description is also available in the zip .\r
1. [MTrackJ]() : Used for visualization of tracks. Preinstalled in Fiji.\r
2. [Imagescience.jar](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/download/imagescience.jar):  This library is used by MTrackJ. Preinstalled in Fiji.\r
3. [jama.jar](http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/). Preinstalled in Fiji.\r
\r
###Advantages: \r
\r
-  support blinking (with a parameters allowing it or not)\r
-  fast, \r
-  can be used in batch, some analysis results provided.\r
-  No dynamic model.\r
-  The tracking part is not dependant of ImageJ.\r
\r
### Pitfalls: \r
-  does not support division, \r
-  the optimization algorithm used is a simulated annealing, so results can be slightly different between two runs. \r
-  No Dynamic model (so less good results but can be used for a first study of the kind of movements)\r
\r
##The sample data \r
\r
The parameters used  for this example data Beads, were \r
\r
1.  detection: 150 \r
2. the max distance in pixels: 20 \r
3. max allowed disappearance in frame: 1\r

Alternative strategy might be to use morphological reconstruction. In short, seed are placed on the image, on objects, then conditionnal dilation is performed from those seeds.\r

Here is how to proceed, using MorphoLibJ:\r

* Open an image\r

It facilitates quantitative, reproducible and objective analysis of the image data. The underlying method of SOAX uses multiple Stretching Open Active Contours (SOACs) that are automatically initialized at image intensity ridges and then stretch along the centerlines of filaments in the network. SOACs can merge, stop at junctions, and reconfigure with others to allow smooth crossing at junctions of filaments.</p>\r
\r
<p>SOAX provides 3D visualization for exploring image data and visually checking results against the image. Quantitative analysis functions based on extracted networks are also implemented in SOAX, including spatial distribution, orientation, and curvature of filamentous structures. SOAX also provides interactive manual editing to further improve the extraction results, which can be saved in a file for archiving or further analysis. Useful for microtubules or actin filaments.</p>\r
\r
<p>Observation: Depending on the operating system, the installation may or may not require Boost C++,&nbsp;ITK and VTK libraries. Windows has a standalone executable application without the need of those.&nbsp;</p>\r

The incessant development of improved microscopy imaging techniques, as well as the advent of highly selective fluorescent dyes has made possible the precise identification of tagged molecules in almost any biological specimen. Of particular interest are the visualization and the study of living cells, which induce tight constraints on the imaging process. To avoid the alteration of the sample and to achieve a high temporal resolution, low fluorophore concentrations, low-power illumination and short exposure time need to be used in practice. Such restrictions have a tremendous impact on the image quality. This is why we have recently introduced a new method, coined PURE-LET [1,2,3], for efficient, fast, and automatic denoising of multidimensional fluorescence microscopy images.""" .

\r
<p>QuimP is software for tracking cellular shape changes and dynamic distributions of fluorescent reporters at the cell membrane. QuimP's unique selling point is the possibility to aggregate data from many cells in form of spatio-temporal maps of dynamic events, independently of cell size and shape. QuimP has been successfully applied to address a wide range of problems related to cell movement in many different cell types.&nbsp;</p>\r
\r
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r
\r
<p>In transmembrane signalling the cell membrane plays a fundamental role in localising intracellular signalling components to specific sites of action, for example to reorganise the actomyosin cortex during cell polarisation and locomotion. The localisation of different components can be directly or indirectly visualised using fluorescence microscopy, for high-throughput screening commonly in 2D. A quantitative understanding demands segmentation and tracking of whole cells and fluorescence signals associated with the moving cell boundary, for example those associated with actin polymerisation at the cell front of locomoting cells. As regards segmentation, a wide range of methods can be used (threshold based, region growing, active contours or level sets) to obtain closed cell contours, which then are used to sample fluorescence adjacent to the cell edge in a straightforward manner. The most critical step however is cell edge tracking, which links points on contours at time t to corresponding points at t+1. Optical flow methods have been employed, but usually fail to meet the requirement that total fluorescence must not change. QuimP uses a method (ECMM, electrostatic contour migration method (Tyson et al., 2010) which has been shown to outperform traditional level set methods. ECMM minimises the sum of path lengths connecting all pairs of points, equivalent to minimising the energy required for cell deformation. The original segmentation based on an active contour method and outline tracking algorithms have been described in (Dormann et al., 2002; Tyson et al., 2010; Tyson et al., 2014).</p>\r

To avoid potential mis-tracing of some parts of a neuron, an APP first produces an initial over-reconstruction, by tracing the optimal geodesic shortest path from the seed location to every possible destination voxel/pixel location in the image. Since the initial reconstruction contains all the possible paths and thus could contain redundant structural components (SC), we simplify the entire reconstruction without compromising its connectedness by pruning the redundant structural elements, using a new maximal- covering minimal-redundant (MCMR) subgraph algorithm. We show that MCMR has a linear computational complexity and will converge. We examined the performance of our method using challenging 3D neuronal image datasets of model organisms (e.g. fruit fly)"</p>\r

The most important idea is to prune an initial reconstruction tree of a neuron’s morphology using a long-segment-first hierarchical procedure instead of the original termini-first-search process in APP. To further enhance the robustness of APP2, we compute the distance transform of all image voxels directly for a gray-scale image, without the need to binarize the image before invoking the conventional dis- tance transform. We also design a fast-marching algorithm-based method to compute the initial reconstruction trees without pre-com- puting a large graph. Thismethod allows us to trace large images.We bench-tested APP2 on ~700 3D microscopic images and found that APP2 can generate more satisfactory results in most cases than sev- eral previous methods."</p>\r

Instead of tracing a 3D image directly in the 3D space as seen in majority of the tracing methods, we first trace the 2D projection trees in 2Dplanes, followed by reverse-mapping the resulting 2D tracing results back into the 3D space as 3D curves; then we use a minimal spanning tree (MST) method to assemble all the 3D curves to generate the final 3D reconstruction. Because we simplify a 3D reconstruction problem into 2D, the computational costs are reduced dramatically."&nbsp;</p>\r

These features are derived from the raw image, transforms of the image, and compound transforms of the image (transforms of transforms). The features are filtered and weighted depending on their effectiveness in discriminating between a set of predefined image classes (the training set). These features are then used to classify test images based on their similarity to the training classes. This classifier was tested on a wide variety of imaging problems including biological and medical image classification using several imaging modalities, face recognition, and other pattern recognition tasks.

    rdfs:comment """<p>WIS-PhagoTracker is a software application for quantitative analysis of high throughput cell migration assay. The cell migration assay is based on a modified Phagokinetic tracks procedure, in which motile cells "leave their tracks" on a specialized surface. These tracks are visualized using a screening microscope. WIS-PhagoTracker enables morphometric analysis of such tracks. It uses multiscale segmentation algorithm for fine detection of tracks and cells boundaries. Following the segmentation step, it quantifies various morphometric parameters for each track, such as track area, perimeter, major and minor axis and solidity. All these measures are calculated for each track in each well of a well plate and saved for further statistical analysis WIS-PhagoTracker supports all the analysis phases starting from preprocessing, finding tracks of selected wells or a whole plate, through viewing the results and manually rejecting tracks to statistical analysis of the results. It also supports batch processing of several plates, and analysis of single image files. A user interface enables the user to modify the relevant parameters of the process, according to specific image's requirements. Results are exported into Excel readable files.</p>\r

It contains algorithms for segmentation of cells and cellular compartments based on various fluorescent markers, features to describe cellular morphology by both texture and shape, tools for visualizing and annotating the phenotypes, classification, tracking and error correction. Events such as mitosis can be automatically identified and aligned to study the temporal kinetics of various cellular processes during cell cycle. CellCognition can be used by novices in the field of image analysis and is applicable to hundreds of thousands of images by parallelization on compute clusters with minimal effort. The tool has been successfully applied to quantitative phenotypic profiling of cell division, yet machine learning enables CellCognition to be used for the analysis of other dynamic processes. ## Backends Following libraries are used: * numpy * [VIGRA](http://biii.info/node/2109) * PyQT * hdf5 * matplotlib * sklearn * Machine Learning in Python</p>\r

CellProfiler is structured so that the most general and successful methods and strategies are the ones that are automatically suggested, but the user can override these defaults and pull from many of the basic algorithms and techniques of image analysis to solve harder problems. CellProfiler is extensible through plugins written in Python or for ImageJ.\r

Icy is an open source bioimaging software package that aims to provide a framework for authors to share, and others to reproduce, research once the sample hits the microscope. Icy was released in April 2011 and is being developed at the Quantitative Image Analysis Unit at the Pasteur Institute in France by Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin and his team. The goal is to provide standardized software architecture, with a visual programming framework and online repository of plugins and protocols, brought together with sophisticated content-management and communication systems for such extended reproducible research. Icy provides intuitive user interfaces for graphical protocol development for image acquisition, analysis and storage that are easy to use for biologists and developers alike. Developers should find that Icys EzPlug API library, versioning, and auditing tools make creating a custom plugin from most any source easy. Users will find the automatic error reporting, central repository and on-line community hub great for storing and sharing plugins and protocols. Icy is even developing a cloud-computing framework to address the scalability issues of high-content screening. As of this writing there are 207 plug-ins 50 scripts and 14 protocols available for download, including those for microscope control, particle tracking, three dimensional segmentation, and even spot detection using wavelets.</p>\r

    rdfs:comment """Definiens is a commercial  image segmentation and classification tool. The user designs a signal processing workflow by combining built-in filtering, thresholding and object classification modules. Object detection is typically done on hierarchical object levels, e.g cell level for  cell objects and organelle level Nucleus and ER obejcts inside a cell object.\r
For each object, a huge set of features (shape-based, intensity based, relations to neighbor objects...) is available and can be used for object classification or merging with neighboring objects. \r
The classical definiens workflow is the so called bottom-up approach: In a first step, the image is segmented in numerous small objects, resulting in a heavy oversegmentation of of the target objects. Objects are then fused step by step on basis of features like relative border to neighbor object or elliptic fit of resulting (fused) object. Objects can assigned to different classes (like nucleus or cancer cell), based on their features. \r
\r
Weaknesses:\r
-complex to use\r
-closed (no API)\r
-very expensive\r
-relatively slow (you have to buy one license for each core)\r
-bad 3D-visualization\r
-time lapse analysis is possible but complicated\r
\r
Strengths:\r
-powerful method to classify objects based on multiple features\r
-2D data, especially histological data\r
-good training material to learn software usage\r
-detailed documentation\r

Visualization tools actively linked to inspect and edit results.\r
Strengths:\r
- Open-source, free, multi platform, code is highly parallelized, uses git for version control\r
- Large scale processing, also efficient visualization of such datasets.\r
- Active learning module for classification\r
- Most of the algorithms have been extended to handle 16-bit images, and 3D Images.\r
- Possibility to create complex pipelines thanks to its modular architecture\r
- Editing tools are designed to save the editing operation which can later be used to validate the algorithms performance\r
- Advance preprocessing algorithms like curvelets, tensor voting, and wrappers around ITK-algorithms\r
- Multiple viewers included to inspect results such as: Histograms, scatter plots, tables, kymograph, all of them linked together.\r
- Strong emphasis to work on multichannel images (up to 40 channels)\r
- Rich number of cell features included \r
Weakness:\r
- GUI is suboptimal compared to commercial packages.\r
- Tracking module requires an external library CPLEX.\r
- No support for brightfield images\r
- No native interoperability with other software packages\r
- More documentation needed / tutorial needed\r

\r
The major strengths are in speed and quality of documentation. Almost all of the functionality is implemented in for multiple dimensions. It can be used with other Python packages which provide additional functionality.\r

    rdfs:comment """<p>Columbus is a combination of an image database (based on Omero, OME) and an image analysis engine based on Acapella (PerkinElmer). It is dedicated to cell culture based high content screening data and is used via a web interface. It provides a set importers for automated microscopes such as Yokogawa CellVoyager, PerkinElmer Operetta, PerkinElmer Opera and data in Metamorph format. After login, Images can be explored in a standard web browser by clicking on a well plate view. Image analysis workflows can be developed by combining modules like "find nuclei", "find cytoplasm", "find spots" for object detection. Objects can have a hierarchical structure, e.g. spot objects can be part of a cell object. The approach of workflow design is similar to the freeware cell profiler, but more restricted (less functions and less parameters to tweak) and easier to use. Mutliple intensity- and shape based features can be calculated from detected objects (e.g. texture: haralick, Garbor, SER). Objects can be classified by these features by using hard thresholds or by supervised machine learning. Analysis workflows and results are stored in the database and can be exprted as csv tables for secondary analysis. Simple secondary analysis workflows can be also applied in Columbus directly. Results can be visualized as heatmaps on the plate view. The HCS statistics software Genedata Screener Assay Analyzer can be directly connected to the database.</p>\r

\r
<p>It provides remote and collaborative principles, rely on data models that allow to easily organize and semantically annotate imaging datasets in a standardized way (using user-defined ontologies associated to regions of interest), efficiently support high-resolution multi-gigapixel images (incl. major digital scanner image formats), and provide mechanisms to readily proofread and share image quantifications produced by any image recognition algorithms.</p>\r

    rdfs:comment """<p>ilastik is a simple, user-friendly tool for&nbsp;<strong>interactive image classification, segmentation and analysis</strong>. It is built as a modular software framework, which currently has&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://ilastik.org/documentation/index.html">workflows</a></strong>&nbsp;for automated (supervised) pixel- and object-level classification, automated and semi-automated object tracking, semi-automated segmentation and object counting without detection. Most analysis operations are performed&nbsp;<strong>lazily</strong>, which enables targeted interactive processing of data subvolumes, followed by complete volume analysis in offline batch mode. Using it requires no experience in image processing.</p>\r
\r
<p>ilastik (the image learning, analysis, and segmentation toolkit) provides non-experts with a menu of pre-built image analysis workflows. ilastik handles data of up to five dimensions (time, 3D space, and spectral dimension). Its workflows provide an interactive experience to give the user immediate feedback on the quality of the results yielded by her chosen parameters and/or labelings.</p>\r
\r
<p>The most commonly used workflow is pixel classification, which requires very little parameter tuning and instead offers a machine learning technique for segmenting an image based on local image features computed for each pixel.</p>\r
\r
<p>Other workflows include:</p>\r
\r
<p>Object classification: Similar to pixel classification, but classifies previously segmented objects by object characteristics&nbsp;in a subsequent step</p>\r
\r
<p>Autocontext:&nbsp;This workflow improves the pixel classification workflow&nbsp;by running it in multiple stages and showing each pixel the results of the previous stage.</p>\r
\r
<p>Carving: Semi-automated segmentation of 3D objects (e.g. neurons) based on user-provided seeds</p>\r
\r
<p>Manual Tracking: Semi-automated cell tracking of 2D+time or 3D+time images based on manual annotations</p>\r
\r
<p>Automated tracking: Fully-automated cell tracking of 2D+time or 3D+time images with some parameter tuning</p>\r
\r
<p>Density Counting: Learned cell population counting based on interactively provided user annotation</p>\r
\r
<p>Strengths: interactive, simple interface (for non-experts), few parameters, larger-than-RAM data, multi-dimensional data (time, 3D space, channel), headless operation, batch mode, parallelized computation, open source</p>\r
\r
<p>Weaknesses: Pre-built workflows (not reconfigurable), no plugin system, visualization sometimes buggy, must import 3D data to HDF5, tracking requires an external CPLEX installation</p>\r
\r
<p>Supported Formats: hdf5, tiff, jpeg, png, bmp, pnm, gif, hdr, exr, sif</p>\r

ImarisSpots for example is a tool to detect spherical objects and track them in time series. Besides the automated detection it gives the user the ability to manually delete and place new spots in 3D space. ImarisCell is a tool to detect nuclei, cell boundaries and vesicles and track these through time. ImarisFilament is a module that lets users trace neurons and detect spines. For any detected object Imaris computes a large set of statistics values such as volume, surface area, maximum intensity of first channel, number of vesicles per cell etc. These values can be exported to Excel and statistics software packages. The measurements can also be analyzed directly within ImarisVantage which is a statistics tool that provides the link back to the 3D objects and the original image data.\r

Icy was released in April 2011 and is being developed at the Quantitative Image Analysis Unit at the Pasteur Institute in France by Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin and his team. The goal is to provide standardized software architecture, with a visual programming framework and online repository of plugins and protocols, brought together with sophisticated content-management and communication systems for such extended reproducible research.<br />\r
Icy provides intuitive user interfaces for graphical protocol development for image acquisition, analysis and storage that are easy to use for biologists and developers alike. Developers should find that Icy’s ‘EzPlug’ API library, versioning, and auditing tools make creating a custom plugin from most any source easy. Users will find the automatic error reporting, central repository and on-line community hub great for storing and sharing plugins and protocols. Icy is even developing a cloud-computing framework to address the scalability issues of high-content screening.<br />\r
As of this writing there are <a href="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/list">207 plug-ins 50 scripts and 14 protocols</a> available for download, including those for microscope control, particle tracking, three dimensional segmentation, and even spot detection using wavelets.<br />\r
Published in Nature Methods (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n7/full/nmeth.2075.html">Nat Methods 9(7):690-6 (2012)</a>).<br />\r

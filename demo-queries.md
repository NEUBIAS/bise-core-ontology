# Sample queries leveraging EDAM-Bioimaging and Bise Core ontologies
## Motivations
[Bise Core Ontology](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/owlapi/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeuBIAS/neubias-data-model/master/owl-ontology/bise-core-ontology-v1.owl#d4e233) has been designed to model and better share the content of the [biii.eu](http://biii.eu) bioimaging ressources repository. [EDAM Bioimaging](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM-BIOIMAGING) aims at capturing domain-specific knowledge related to bioimaging data analysis in terms of [topics](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM-BIOIMAGING/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fedamontology.org%2Ftopic_0003) and [operations](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM-BIOIMAGING/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fedamontology.org%2Foperation_0004) .
This web page briefly illustrates sample queries benefiting from knowledge captured in these two ontologies. Still, the RDF data dump is in a very preliminary stage and covers only few concepts and relations.
